  <title> Ethics Statement | Nicole van der Hoeven</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Hi, I&#39;m Nicole van der Hoeven. I&#39;m a Developer Advocate at k6.io. I&#39;ve spent my career making software faster as a load tester. I&#39;m a proud polynational (Filipino, Australian, and Dutch), polyglot (currently learning TL, EN, NL, ES, EO, DE, FR), and polymath. I publicly learn cool things I have no business learning, then share what I&#39;ve learned. I write technical and fictional articles and books, film and produce videos, create podcasts, speak at conferences, and otherwise just generally enjoy getting to know people. This site is a home for everything I&#39;m doing on the interwebs, but my real-life home these days is Maastricht, in the Netherlands.">

    <h1 id="my-ethics-statement">My Ethics Statement</h1>
<p>This statement governs my principles regarding my activities as a content creator. I&rsquo;ve made this information public for transparency, consistency, and fairness in my dealings with viewers, readers, employers, and sponsors alike. It is a list of my expectations from others, but it also a list of what others can expect from me.</p>
<h2 id="promotions-and-sponsorships">Promotions and sponsorships</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve personally paid for at least 95%, if not more, of the gear and apps I use to create content. The remaining 5% have been purchased for me by previous and current employers in the course of my normal day job. These cases cover things like laptops that I am allowed to use for personal work as well. I never expense items through my employer if their primary use is for my personal projects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Promotion&rdquo; includes me doing one, or a combination, of the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Talking positively about a product or service, digital or analog, in any form of media, including social media networks, videos, blog posts, or collaborations.</li>
<li>Using a product in a video or photo.</li>
<li>Showing a product on video or in a photo, including in the background.</li>
<li>Reviewing a product or service.</li>
</ul>
<p>Promotion includes compensation in the following forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>money (paid promotion or sponsorship)</li>
<li>access to a digital app/service</li>
<li>&ldquo;free&rdquo; products</li>
<li>nothing (in cases where I have no relationship at all with a company but still choose to promote their products)</li>
</ul>
<p>When I promote a product or service:</p>
<ul>
<li>I clearly spell out in the video and/or text the nature of what I received in compensation for the promotion, if any.</li>
<li>I tick the &ldquo;includes paid promotion&rdquo; on YouTube videos if I have received money. I do not tick it in the case of free products.</li>
<li>I state any potential financial stake I have (such as personal investment, employment, or affiliation) with the company.</li>
<li>I do it out in the open. I don&rsquo;t do sneaky product placements.</li>
</ul>
<p>I only promote a product or service if:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is something I already use regularly or genuinely feel would add value to my life. This also means that apps I promote must be accessible on devices I actually use! For an app: If I don&rsquo;t use it daily or weekly at the very least, it&rsquo;s out. If I don&rsquo;t think I would continue to use it after the promotion for whatever reason, I won&rsquo;t promote it.</li>
<li>I am <em>excited</em> by the prospect of using it&ndash; it&rsquo;s not enough to think it&rsquo;s serviceable. Lukewarm feelings don&rsquo;t cut it, either.</li>
<li>(In the case of a review) The company does NOT have any input on what I say. They don&rsquo;t get to see videos for approval or revisions before I publish them.</li>
<li>The company that produces it is ethical in its practices. I don&rsquo;t claim to know everything, but I will never knowingly promote a product from a company with deplorable practices.</li>
<li>It is open-source OR has features that make it more compelling than open-source alternatives. I always prioritize open-source tools over commercial offerings.</li>
<li>(In the case of paid promotions) It does not directly compete with my permanent employer, Grafana Labs (and k6)&ndash; not because I don&rsquo;t welcome the competition, but because I am under contractual obligations to avoid this conflict of interest.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="unsolicited-benefits">Unsolicited benefits</h3>
<p>Giving me a free product does not mean I am under an obligation to mention it, and it certainly doesn&rsquo;t guarantee a positive review. Please don&rsquo;t send me anything with strings I haven&rsquo;t agreed to.</p>
<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s ok to disagree with me, and I especially welcome constructive feedback. I don&rsquo;t delete comments that disagree with me, but be nice; I&rsquo;m a person too. So are other commenters.</p>
<p>I will not hesitate to delete, block, or reject comments if:</p>
<ul>
<li>they are discriminatory in any way (racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ageist, anything that involves projecting qualities onto an entire group)</li>
<li>they include swear words meant to denigrate others or express frustration. Be civil and rational in your discourse.</li>
<li>they are spam.</li>
<li>they are obvious attempts to promote your own product, service, or content.</li>
<li>they reveal personally identifiable information about anyone.</li>
</ul>
