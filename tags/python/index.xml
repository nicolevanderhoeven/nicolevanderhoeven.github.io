You may not get courses that qualify as university credit, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found it to be a useful resource for learning. I might be biased (my university degree is in Economics, which I&amp;rsquo;ve never used), but in some ways, I actually prefer a MOOC (that&amp;rsquo;s a Massively Open Online Course) to a typical formal university course for a few reasons:</description>
