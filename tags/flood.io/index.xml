People often start load testing by creating a script in their favorite load testing tool, but good load testing starts before that. Planning a load test may seem like a tedious exercise, but it is essential to ensuring the success of your testing.
A test plan should answer why, what, who, when, and how the testing will be carried out.
A good test plan, particularly for load testing, includes the following components:</description>

In this video, I discuss how to make your load testing scripts more realistic by including test data. The load testing tool I use is Flood Element, but you can apply these principles to any tool. You&amp;rsquo;ll find a copy of the Element script I used below.
‍   And, if you prefer, here&amp;rsquo;s the audio version:

We&amp;rsquo;re excited to welcome another cloud provider to the Flood lineup, giving you even more options for running your load tests. You can now use Flood to run load tests on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Many of you have requested an integration with Google Cloud, citing many of its strengths:
 Full integrations with open-source tools like Influx and Redis World-class security High-performance global network  Seamless access to other apps in the Google ecosystem, such as Search and Maps</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ve always been a fully distributed team at Flood, but the current world crisis has still changed the way we work. Here are some of the things we&amp;rsquo;re doing to keep self-isolation from being too isolating— and maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll help your team too!
Within the Flood team, flooders-in-training (aka children) have made more surprise appearances in team meetings. Work has been punctuated with grocery runs to buy essentials before they run out.</description>

      <description>In this video, I talk about how to install the JMeter Plugin Manager as well as other plugins, what the best JMeter plugins are, and why you need them. JMeter is an open-source load testing tool that is already robust, but there are some fantastic plugins that have been developed for it that you might want to use in your next load test.
