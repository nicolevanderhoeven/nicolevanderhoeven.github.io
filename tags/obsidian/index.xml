      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Obsidian Dice Roller plugin lets you use randomness in Obsidian to provoke serendipity in personal knowledge management. Dice Roller is a plugin that was created for use in tabletop roleplaying games, but you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a gamer to be able to use it to spark creativity in your thinking for other topics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the future of Obsidian? The new Obsidian CEO, Stephan Ango (@kepano), talks about why he joined the Obsidian team and what he wants to do next. I&amp;rsquo;m Nicole van der Hoeven, and today I&amp;rsquo;m joined by my friend, Andy Polaine, to find out what&amp;rsquo;s on the horizon for our favourite note-taking app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a transcript of the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introductions-nicole-van-der-hoeven-stephan-ango-andy-polaine&#34;&gt;Introductions: Nicole van der Hoeven, Stephan Ango, Andy Polaine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Hello, everyone. I&amp;rsquo;m Nicole van der Hoeven, and today I&amp;rsquo;m joined by two special guests. And I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce first, I guess, Stephan Ango, or you might know him better as Kepano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Hey, Nicole. Thank you for having me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: You&amp;rsquo;re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Kepano&amp;rsquo;s great. You can call me Kepano. I&amp;rsquo;m fine with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: So, Stephan is a designer and an engineer, and most recently, he was announced to be the CEO of Obsidian. So that&amp;rsquo;s going to be interesting. I actually know you more for the stuff that you&amp;rsquo;ve made for Obsidian, like Minimal, and also Hider and Web Clipper. But it looks like you&amp;rsquo;ve been in the industry for a while making, I&amp;rsquo;d say similar tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah. Well, I mean, up until now it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really in the consumer space. I was building startups in more in the B2B area, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a lot of these tools for a long time. So, as a user, I&amp;rsquo;m older than I look, I guess. I&amp;rsquo;ve been like, building, I think the first thing that I really got into when I was a teenager was Winamp Skins. And so like, this is like, &amp;rsquo;90s, early 2000s, making my first website and things around that time. So that&amp;rsquo;s how, that was my first, I guess, experience, like, building things in the software world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Awesome. And also here to help me interview you basically, is Andy Polaine, who is a lot of things. Designer, educator, writer, design leadership coach. He&amp;rsquo;s also co-authored a book called, &amp;ldquo;Service Design: From Insight to Implementation.&amp;rdquo; And he has a podcast called, &amp;ldquo;Power of Ten.&amp;rdquo; But really, the most important thing is he&amp;rsquo;s my Dungeon Master. We play D&amp;amp;D every week, and he&amp;rsquo;s also a good friend. We actually met because of Obsidian. So, welcome to the channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Thanks. Thanks for having me on. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to be a co-host. Or co-interviewer. Co-interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s really weird for me to not take cues from you and roll dice when you tell me to, but, you know, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how that goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I&amp;rsquo;ve got the dice here just in case we need-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Okay, well I&amp;rsquo;ve got mine too, so. Anytime you need me to roll a save, I&amp;rsquo;m ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Well, let&amp;rsquo;s just roll for initiative to see who interviews first, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Yeah. Okay, let&amp;rsquo;s do that. Rollies, what are you going to roll? Okay. Just a d20. I rolled a two, so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I got an 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: You go first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pkm-history-and-getting-started-with-obsidian&#34;&gt;PKM history and getting started with Obsidian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Okay, all right. I will, so, really, the first question for you is, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of under a sort of batch of questions really, about why Obsidian, but how did you get started with Obsidian?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: First, can you give me any like, buffs or stats or anything as my character would?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Well, I think you get sort of plus one in design and coding, right? So, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: What class do you think Stephan would be, Andy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Wizard, I reckon. Or an arcanist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Yeah, I was thinking like-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: No, I reckon-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Sorcerer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Yeah, or a, you know, someone who kind of makes stuff as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Artificer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Artificer, yeah. That&amp;rsquo;s what I reckon he is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Back in the World of Warcraft days-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: So high end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: I played a lot of the paladin class. I like the hybrid class, but I think that I also in like, &amp;ldquo;Lord of the Rings&amp;rdquo; really love, you know, Gandalf and those types of guy, Radagast, you know. I&amp;rsquo;m definitely into those types of characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Someone who can produce something out of nothing. So. So. As you were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: I forgot what your question was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Yes, so we&amp;rsquo;re going to lose half the audience straightaway. So, you know, you were a customer, right? You were a user before you became CEO and pretty quickly I seem to remember seeing your, certainly your theme, I think, probably a couple of other things, seeing you in the Obsidian Discord. So, you know, what was your hook into Obsidian in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: We&amp;rsquo;re getting some comments that your mic is very crackly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: We are hearing it. This is weird, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I had it before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Some people are hearing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: But to answer your question, I had been using the, over the past like, 15 or so years, I&amp;rsquo;ve used a lot of different tools to kind of try to solve what for me was mostly a journaling question. So, I wanted to be able to just write kind of, my own diary notes in a tool that, over time I discovered that the Wiki type of format was what I really loved. I kind of fell in love with the wiki link kind of idea. And that idea&amp;rsquo;s been around, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure exactly who invented the notation. I think it was the Wikipedia people in the MediaWiki, the kind of like, double-bracket concept. But once I discovered that, I felt that I only wanted to use like, journaling with that. So the one that I used for a long time was TiddlyWiki, and TiddlyWiki has that same kind of bracket notation, but I found that my personal sensibilities as a user, I really wanted something that felt like, very simple and minimalistic. Like, as you may notice from the kind of like, type of themes and things that I&amp;rsquo;ve made for Obsidian. And when Obsidian came out, I found out about it almost right away, like, in, I guess April, 2020, you know, as right as the pandemic was kicking off. Like, I think a lot of people, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, around that time were staying at home, were exploring different things and I found out about it, I had spent probably a year trying to kind of customize TiddlyWiki to be a little bit more user friendly, and Obsidian, even in like, V1 or whatever, not V1, it was like, V0.001, was already better than what TiddlyWiki was doing for me in terms of, it had the quick switcher, it had the prompts, it had the file Nav in the way that I wanted. It didn&amp;rsquo;t quite look like what I wanted, but it had a lot of the kind of, nice user interface patterns that I was looking for. And so I pretty much started making, I took, I was looking back at my notes, kind of preparing for this conversation, and I pretty much went all in on Obsidian after using it just for a couple days. I imported everything, and started making the minimal theme like, immediately. But I was just making it for myself at first. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t intending to publish it, I just kind of made it to solve my own UI preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: So I actually used TiddlyWiki quite a bit. The reason that I used it was a lot of, &amp;lsquo;cause I was a consultant at the time, and a lot of the tools that were out there required, like, they were basically on the cloud so it was a SaaS platform that I&amp;rsquo;d have to log into and not, and those sites weren&amp;rsquo;t always allowed by whatever company I happened to be working for, so that&amp;rsquo;s what I loved about TiddlyWiki, that it could just sit on like, a flash drive and it would work. And that&amp;rsquo;s part of the reason that I started using Obsidian too, is &amp;lsquo;cause it&amp;rsquo;s local.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah. Yeah, and that was something, you know, being able to use it on your computer when you&amp;rsquo;re offline, just having that control. I was, you know, using it on flights, and so that local first idea to me is, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I just find it much more natural and it allows you to do things so much faster. And because I have experience, you know, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say that like, being an engineer is first and foremost what I do, but I do dabble in a lot of different things on the code side and using, I use Sublime Text as my main code editor, but having, being used to using like, a code editor, you just expect everything to be there for you, right away, super fast. Like, even a small delay feels like it gets in the way of my productivity in some cases. So, being in the cloud, it always feels a little slow. And I&amp;rsquo;ve used a lot of those tools in my previous, especially for work purposes like Confluence or Google Docs or those things. And the sluggishness I feel like, really gets in the way of being able to make progress on whatever you&amp;rsquo;re trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Yeah. I mean for me, it was the portability thing. I switched to Markdown for everything, I think, for my blog. Like really, really soon after Gruber kind of released it. And I used to use Notational Velocity, which I think it was probably one of the first ones I know of, of a kind of this idea of a database that just sits on top of a bunch of Markdown files. And then Brett Terpstra was putting together NvALT, and nvUltra, which he&amp;rsquo;s still working on. And you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty disloyal. I&amp;rsquo;ve used lots and lots of like, every and probably most people, every Markdown out there. And a lot of them are starting to do the kind of wiki thing too, but depending-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: And there&amp;rsquo;s so many of them and-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Yeah. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: And I think that is such a great thing that now that the ecosystem of Markdown editing tools is so deep and broad, that I often think that Obsidian, to me what&amp;rsquo;s exciting about this whole kind of area is like, I&amp;rsquo;m very curious about how we can make digital information persist over a long period of time. Like, how will the ideas that we have right now continue to persist for hundreds of years in the future? We&amp;rsquo;ve had books for thousands of years, but we&amp;rsquo;ve only had digital files for, you know, 70 or 80 years. And I like the idea that something like, plain text could still be around for the next few hundred years. And so using something like Markdown is, like, the file in a way is way more important than the apps. Like, Obsidian will eventually become obsolete because technology changes so much. But hopefully, the plain text will continue to live forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Yeah. I mean a bit like you, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna ask you about Computer Show actually later, but a bit like you, I&amp;rsquo;ve been around for quite a long time and I thought, I&amp;rsquo;ve been in digital stuff for like, 30-something years and I got fed up, but one of the reasons I moved to doing everything, I do all that, still do my invoicing, you know, with Markdown and stuff because I had so many times where like, &amp;ldquo;Oh the app&amp;rsquo;s gone out of, you know, out of production,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve got so much of my work still on like, CD-ROMs.&amp;rdquo; I keep an old laptop that&amp;rsquo;s still got a CD-ROM drive, just in order to be able to view that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Oh, really? You&amp;rsquo;ve got to transfer those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: It still runs, kinda like, oh, it&amp;rsquo;s a, no, but yeah, but some of it&amp;rsquo;s like, Director MacroMind, actually, Macromedia Director stuff, that that&amp;rsquo;s the only thing you can play on, so you sort of have to keep the machine for it, too. And I transferred a lot of other stuff, but I had the same thing and I started using Evernote once and then trying getting stuff out. It was horrendous. Had the same thing with Notions, of exporting out of Notion, and it kind of dumps all this other crap in there. And so, you know, yeah, I agree. I think the file format is the kind of winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah, the file is more important than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dealing-with-competitors&#34;&gt;Dealing with competitors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I&amp;rsquo;m interested though more as CEO, that you&amp;rsquo;ve got, you know, there are a whole lot of, well, I kind of would perhaps a little bit rudely say Obsidian clones kind of popping up. It feels like, in the last, you know, even in the last year there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of stuff coming up. So, you know, whether you perceive those, is that a challenge for Obsidian? Is Obsidian kind of, just take its own path that each of them have their kind of own flavors? Now is it a good thing, you see it as a good thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Well, I see it as a good thing because I am still kind of like, a plain text maximalist. So I think that you have to have a diversity of clients in order for that to kind of last forever. Like, I still think the file is more important than the app. I do think that where it gets dangerous is if there&amp;rsquo;s too many app-specific syntaxes that start to emerge. I think that is kind of dangerous because it reduces interoperability. Like, I think that, you know, Markdown, for all its flaws, and I think a lot of people have frustrations with Markdown, it has kind of stood the test of time, at least for the past, however many, 12, 15 years it&amp;rsquo;s been around, I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure, but maybe more at this point, I&amp;rsquo;m getting old. And so, I think that that is one of the biggest challenges that we have with Obsidian is sometimes we wanna do something new. Like, recently we launched the Canvas feature and there isn&amp;rsquo;t a, you know, off-the-shelf kind of canvas type of bio format. So we, you know, created a new one that is, you know, open and the type specification for it is out there, but there&amp;rsquo;s no other client for that file format yet. Hopefully there will be, but I think that that diversity of clients is good because there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of people who have lots of different ideas about how thinking should work, and Obsidian is not particularly dogmatic, like, a big part of, you know, one of the main values that we always think about is extensibility. So how do we make it easy for individual users to customize Obsidian? And also, how do we enable developers to build on top of it? But there&amp;rsquo;s a, I think it&amp;rsquo;s very viable to create a very opinionated Markdown or tool, you know, editing tool that takes a different approach than Obsidian. And I&amp;rsquo;ve seen many people who enjoy using more than one, different one for different parts of their workflow. So yeah, I think it&amp;rsquo;s good. I think we&amp;rsquo;re living through a little bit of like, this Cambrian explosion moment because for some reason right now, in the past couple of years, like, people have realized this a really exciting problem to work on and I think we all learn a lot from each other, so, I see it as a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: So one of the things that you said, &amp;lsquo;cause I trolled through your blog while I was thinking of questions for this. You had a post about how great tools choose to be bad at some things. So, what do you think Obsidian has chosen to be bad at?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Well, I think that design principles are only real design principles if you can take both sides of it and create something compelling. Like, for example, we talked about extensibility. That&amp;rsquo;s one of our, I would say there&amp;rsquo;s like, three major pillars to what Obsidian is trying to be. One of them is around privacy, one of them is around longevity of your notes, and one of them is around extensibility. So those three things are the things that we want to continue being really good at. But you can take the extensibility example as kind of one of our design principles. We wanna make Obsidian super extensible. But you could, I can see why some people would prefer an app that&amp;rsquo;s not at all extensible, that is, you know, completely designed by one small group of people who are trying to make a very cohesive experience. I think one of the big challenges with Obsidian is we&amp;rsquo;re always asking ourselves, &amp;ldquo;What should be a community plugin versus a core plugin?&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;re always asking ourselves, &amp;ldquo;How can we make community plugins feel more native to the app and more cohesive and intuitive to people? Do they make sense with the rest of the app? Because any developer can basically build anything inside of Obsidian. And so it, I think it is a common point of frustration for some new Obsidian users that they have to download a lot of plugins and some of them feel a little janky. So, you know, Obsidian has chosen to be bad at that, with the trade off that it allows a lot of freedom for people to customize the app. And you can take the same example with, you know, privacy and longevity. Those have their own trade offs as well. Andy, did you wanna say something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I was thinking, you know, it reminded me of what you just said. It was just as you talked about the plugin thing. One of the tricks that Apple did with the iPhone, was to make the phone bit an app. And it sounds just like, a really banal thing, but up until then there were phones, smartphones, were kind of phones with sort of app bits in them, and they were really janky. And I think one of the things also, obviously not having a keyboard, having a touch screen, means that that thing where you get whatever app you&amp;rsquo;re in is completely the app. All right? So, you know, I&amp;rsquo;m in FaceTime, it&amp;rsquo;s completely FaceTime, I&amp;rsquo;m in Obsidian and it&amp;rsquo;s completely Obsidian, the whole phone turns into whatever app you&amp;rsquo;re in. And I feel that, you know, in a way that&amp;rsquo;s what the plugin mechanism can do for Obsidian. At its base it&amp;rsquo;s, you know, it&amp;rsquo;s a text editor that&amp;rsquo;s browsing as a viewer on a set of Markdown files. But you know, as soon as you start putting, particularly some of the more powerful plugins in it, it becomes something completely else. And I think, I find it really kind of powerful that you can switch that stuff on and off. I can see that the, you know, I was sharing my students the other day &amp;lsquo;cause they were talking about design research and how you can use Obsidian, and quite a lot of them use Notion. And I can completely see why they use Notion, right? &amp;lsquo;Cause it&amp;rsquo;s just, you know, zero learning curve for them. Until such time as they want to take that stuff with them, and then they&amp;rsquo;ll find out. And I think some of that stuff&amp;rsquo;s a bit like doing backups. You find out the hard way, right? But I kind of feel like that is a, it&amp;rsquo;s been a smart trade off to make with Obsidian, with the plugins. And I was just wondering at this point-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: But it has its downsides. I mean, I think the point, you know, on privacy, the way we think about that is that is having ownership over your files. They&amp;rsquo;re not in somebody else&amp;rsquo;s database. They&amp;rsquo;re on your computer, on your device. You know, if you choose to use the first-party sync, everything&amp;rsquo;s end-to-end encrypted, and so we have this kind of strong pillar around privacy, but it has the trade off that it makes certain things harder for us. For example, people ask us, would we ever see a web client for Obsidian? A like, online, you know, cloud-based Obsidian? And that&amp;rsquo;s a lot harder for us to do because we don&amp;rsquo;t have access to your files. We would have to compromise on that value of encrypting your data and kind of being able to see that information on our side in order to be able to present it back to you. And that makes things really tough. Unless, there&amp;rsquo;s some, we&amp;rsquo;ve thought about this question a lot, but it really is a very hard problem to solve. But for someone who, you know, for whatever scenario they might be in, either can&amp;rsquo;t access a local app because they, you know, there were computer restricts, you know, apps and they can&amp;rsquo;t download Obsidian or they&amp;rsquo;re on a school computer and they have to access it from the school computer, it does present a limitation. But I think strong principles force those kinds of trade-offs where you could take either side and make a compelling and legitimate app. We just, you know, have chosen our own particular set of trade off and that&amp;rsquo;s what that blog post was about. So. So there&amp;rsquo;s other things that Obsidian is bad at as well, like, relating to longevity and like, the choice of using Markdown, for example. It&amp;rsquo;s not the most intuitive to some people. I can come up with a long list of things that Obsidian is bad at, in favor of something that it wants to be really good at. And I think that&amp;rsquo;s a, making trade offs is our job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Well, one of the things that I hear a lot is that Obsidian is too developer focused, or some people think it&amp;rsquo;s not approachable. And I think it comes back to what we&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about. You do have to make a decision, you do sacrifice a little bit of usability in exchange for flexibility and modularity. My background is in performance engineering, so I care a lot about performance and I love this idea of making the most streamlined possible app, and then just leaving room for extensions so that other people can make their own decisions. I would rather have that, than have an app that has everything baked in and I have really no choice as to what to turn on or off because my use case is going to be different from everybody else&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: That&amp;rsquo;s Microsoft Word, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: When you just have the sort of, bloat and they get those screenshots, sometimes, of every palette open and there&amp;rsquo;s about this much space, they actually edit some text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: By the way, do you like my shirt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Oh yes. Classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Where&amp;rsquo;s yours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: How disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: I know, I haven&amp;rsquo;t, I&amp;rsquo;m such a minimalist-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: It&amp;rsquo;s a print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten my Obsidian merch yet, but, yeah, you&amp;rsquo;re looking good over there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: So, you know, you&amp;rsquo;ve been contributing to Obsidian, pretty much from the get go, and then you started working with them. What is it with them? It&amp;rsquo;s the, the Licat and Silver, basically-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: It&amp;rsquo;s the smart, yeah, the smart team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;joining-the-obsidian-team&#34;&gt;Joining the Obsidian team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Two-person team. So, you know, how did that, I don&amp;rsquo;t know how much you can reveal, how did that come about and then, and what was the sort of transition? When was there this kind of moment of like, &amp;ldquo;Hey, how about becoming CEO?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah, well, it was a very organic process because I, you know, was running a different company at the time when Obsidian first came out. And so, I had, you know, started building minimal theme, a bunch of different small plugins here and there, the Web Clipper. And I was a very vocal in the Discord and forum about some of the things that I thought would be, you know, improvements or bug fixes. And at the time, the Obsidian community was way smaller than it is today. And so, I was often interacting with Licat and Silver, the founders of Obsidian, through the Discord. And just kind of, just talking very organically about here are some things that could be improved, here are some, you know, bugs I found. Can you help me with this feature of Minimal that I am trying to, you know, build into my plugin? Can you give me some feedback on how to do this properly? And so, we started interacting, you know, talking about Obsidian for a couple of years. And, I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure at what point it started, and maybe it was around the time that, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to like, actually remember, but I think there was like, a Gems of the Year contest where Minimal won like, the Best Theme category, and I think I started DMing more with Silver and Licat around that time, and just kind of getting to know them just over chat in Discord. And they found out that I had been, you know, running some startups and asked me for some advice on a couple small things here and there. And so we just kind of kept that conversation going, and at some point last year, there was this kind of idea that Obsidian wanted to kinda reach the 1.0 release. And the 1.0 release, I mean I think it, you know, it&amp;rsquo;s funny that it, it was really a milestone moment, because we, that&amp;rsquo;s when I started becoming involved in the project and they asked me to basically create the new default theme. And so I was working with them part-time, kind of taking a lot of my experience on Minimal and bringing that into the core app. But also, they were asking me about some of the things that I felt were on my like, top priority list of small details that we felt were still kind of embarrassing or like, wanted to really get nailed down before we could really feel like we could call it a 1.0. And, that&amp;rsquo;s when I started working much more closely with them, as well as Liam, who is now a full-time part of the team. You might know Liam from the calendar plugin. He&amp;rsquo;s amazing. We have basically five people full-time. Joethei, you might have seen around the community who helps a lot with plugin reviews and the developer ecosystem, and then a few other folks who&amp;rsquo;ve been helping us part-time, like MG Meyers, who you might know from the Kanban plugin and style settings is working on, has been working on Canvas and kind of like, led the Canvas effort. And so, the more conversations kept going on with this project, I just realized it was so much fun and I love Obsidian so much. Like I just, I really want it to continue to be an important tool in my life, in a very selfish way, but also I think that Shida and Erica, Licat and Silver, are such mature like, entrepreneurs, they&amp;rsquo;re quite a bit younger than me. They make me feel old all the time. But it&amp;rsquo;s a great exchange of knowledge and yeah, so we started discussing this idea and they were on board. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a very, we have very complimentary skills. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about, like, Licat&amp;rsquo;s one of the most incredible engineers that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked with. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with a lot of like, amazing engineers throughout my life and I have like, so much respect for him. He&amp;rsquo;s just super, super impressive and continues to be like, they&amp;rsquo;re both gonna continue to be involved for the foreseeable future. And Erica has just an incredible mind for, you know, product and how to think about what users really care about. And so, and has been, I think, the person who&amp;rsquo;s, in a way, influenced why Obsidian has such an amazing community more than anybody else. Just kind of from the beginning, making that an important part of Obsidian, I think is a lot of credit to Erica. So, seeing, like, getting to know them just made me realize like, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing that I would rather do than help that community continue to grow, help make sure that Obsidian has the, kind of like, structure that it can last for a long time, kind of going back to that principle of longevity that matters at the app level. How do we actually make that viable at the company level so that the kind of, product and the company can be aligned? So yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s why I kind of believe that-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: I also just wanted to call out-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Very organic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole There&amp;rsquo;s some people who are asking-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Oh, where do we get the merchandise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Where do we get the merch? By the way, I bought this. And it is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Just so everybody can see, &amp;lsquo;cause there&amp;rsquo;s some awesome things on there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah, I think it&amp;rsquo;s-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: I want I wanted to ask you-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-intentional-tools-for-tool-builders&#34;&gt;Building intentional tools for tool builders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Yeah, it is. So I wanted to also ask you, earlier when I was introducing you, I said that you have worked in similar spaces, which I realize now is a bit odd because the companies that you had worked on before aren&amp;rsquo;t note-taking apps. But what I meant by that, is actually I&amp;rsquo;m seeing a theme in what you&amp;rsquo;ve worked on and it&amp;rsquo;s all about creating things that are minimal, intentional, well-made. And I think like, in your previous company, Lumi, you were talking about packaging, and making that a little bit more transparent and intentional as well. I know you&amp;rsquo;re also an industrial designer, or you claim not to be one anymore, but that&amp;rsquo;s also something that permeates your work there as well, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m a generalist. I like to dabble in a lot of different things. And so, it has taken me in a lot of different directions, but I think the common theme is I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in making tools. So everything basically in my professional career has been a tool of some kind. So in the case of Lumi, it was a tool, it was actually two different tools. One was for factories, to help manufacturers kind of bring their capabilities online, and a tool that helped businesses who need to collaborate with manufacturers, find the right manufacturers and work with them. And so, I like building tools that kind of empower individuals to do something that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t do before. And so Obsidian definitely fits into that because I feel like, I mean, in my own personal life, it&amp;rsquo;s been so rewarding and exciting to use Obsidian. Like, I feel like, my thought process is clear and more reliable when I&amp;rsquo;m using Obsidian. And I feel like, that&amp;rsquo;s such an exciting superpower that I have that I want to help more people get that feeling, too. So yeah, like, throughout my life basically like, that theme just keeps coming back of like, making tools that help other people do whatever they&amp;rsquo;re trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: And it&amp;rsquo;s also helping other people make other things, right? &amp;lsquo;Cause like, you know, you&amp;rsquo;ve also worked on things like, that kind of pare down what is out there, because there&amp;rsquo;s an information overload that&amp;rsquo;s out there and I know you&amp;rsquo;ve made like, Tidy, which kind of streamlines what we even see on the page. What do you think, is there anything in Obsidian, &amp;lsquo;cause we&amp;rsquo;ve talked about things that it&amp;rsquo;s bad at. Are there any big features that you&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce to it, that don&amp;rsquo;t detract from, that don&amp;rsquo;t make it like this bloated bit of software but still are along the same lines of being intentional and helping people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Definitely. I think that the area we want to keep working on is the primitives. Like, what are the basic things that you can use that you can build on top of? So, we have a public roadmap that&amp;rsquo;s not always the most up to date, but one of the big things we&amp;rsquo;re working on right now is around metadata. So, a lot of, I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan in my personal use, of DataView is one of my favorite plugins for Obsidian, and I use it for everything. And kind of asking ourselves like, &amp;ldquo;What can we do that would enable the user and developer ecosystem of Obsidian to leverage metadata even more?&amp;rdquo; So, you know, you can, there&amp;rsquo;s a couple different ways that you can add metadata to your notes with Obsidian. One of them is through YAML in the frontmatter, and one of them is through DataView has these like, custom fields. So that&amp;rsquo;s an area that, we want to, like, the author of DataView had to create this new notation with the double colon. You know, you put a key in a value and separate them with a double colon, and that notation was essentially invented by the author of DataView because it&amp;rsquo;s so painful to write YAML. And so, what can we do to clean that up a little bit and make metadata feel more like a first-class citizen from the user&amp;rsquo;s perspective, but also enable more developers to build on top of that. Yeah, API docs and developer portal. I&amp;rsquo;m looking, I can&amp;rsquo;t even remember what we have on here. Tasks. There&amp;rsquo;s a few other things that we have up our sleeve at the moment, that I&amp;rsquo;ll be excited to share in a little bit. Talking about the roadmap-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: A few questions, Stephan-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah, go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: You mentioned DataView. I know that he&amp;rsquo;s working on DataCore, right? Is that going to be something that&amp;rsquo;s going to be built into Obsidian or is it still going to be a community plugin? Honestly, I would never use Obsidian without DataView.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: You know, I haven&amp;rsquo;t really, I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure what the goals of DataCore are. I&amp;rsquo;m not super informed about what he&amp;rsquo;s trying to do with that. I think that our job is always to find the right balance between what feels like a core plugin, what feels like it should be part of the community. And so, I think that long term we do wanna have good ways for people to add metadata to their notes and perhaps view kind of an output of that in some way. I think that&amp;rsquo;s kind of a long-term project, but in the short term, the metadata improvements is really about making it a lot easier to add metadata to your notes and then hopefully that makes things like DataView easier to use. But maybe long term will consider some more ways that people can like, look and view their data, or the metadata from their notes. I do found that DataView, one challenge with it is it is pretty nerdy. Like, it does require, it has a syntax that&amp;rsquo;s a little bit, you know, like, SQL and I think that that&amp;rsquo;s not the most user friendly. So we&amp;rsquo;ve seen quite a few plugins pop up, like DB Folder is one that&amp;rsquo;s kind of interesting that makes it a little bit more WYSIWYG. And that&amp;rsquo;s one of the big benefits that we have as a community is that people can build plugins that optimize for different types of users. People who love writing SQL, they&amp;rsquo;re gonna love using DataView, but people who prefer something more WYSIWYG are gonna prefer a different type of UI. And we can be patient in our approach to what we actually wanna build into the core because we could just kind of watch what people like, what people make, and decide later down the road what we wanna build ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;growth-of-obsidian-as-a-team-and-company&#34;&gt;Growth of Obsidian as a team and company&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Do you think there are, I mean are there any plans to then grow the team? Or is partly what makes it special, the fact that you are a very small team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: I think that for now we wanna stay really small. We wanna be as small as we can be because, you know, one of the other things that&amp;rsquo;s really important that made me want to join Obsidian, is that from an early stage, Shida and Erica decided that they didn&amp;rsquo;t wanna bring on investors, like, venture capital investors. And I have, throughout my career, worked and built companies that have used every single funding model under the sun. Like, my first company was one of the very first Kickstarter campaigns ever, back in 2009. I&amp;rsquo;ve gone down the venture capital route, I&amp;rsquo;ve done bootstrapping, like, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried it all. And I think when it comes to the goals of Obsidian that we&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about, like, longevity in particular comes to mind, but also privacy and extensibility, I find that is not very compatible with the VC route. And, you know, if you just kind of survey the ecosystem, you&amp;rsquo;ll find that actually, almost all of the kind of big PKM apps, if you wanna call them that, have raised a lot of money, like, millions of dollars from, or hundreds of millions of dollars, even. And the problem with that is that, I think it&amp;rsquo;s misaligning the incentives in the long term for, you know, the user and how they want to kind of, store their notes. Like, basically it incentivizes certain behaviors that are kind of against our principles. And so for that reason, we&amp;rsquo;re trying to build very intentionally and also work through the extensibility part of our like, principle to enable the community to customize things more. Like, we don&amp;rsquo;t feel like it&amp;rsquo;s necessarily our job to make this like, huge app that has every single feature. We like seeing how the community kind of extends Obsidian in their own ways. So I would say that growing the team, it will be more by necessity than by a desire to like, try to do everything ourselves. We&amp;rsquo;re getting to a point now where, I would guess, we don&amp;rsquo;t actually even know how many Obsidian users there are because we&amp;rsquo;re so focused on privacy, we don&amp;rsquo;t have analytics, we just like, don&amp;rsquo;t know. But we can guess based on a few different like, things like, how many people downloaded the app bundle, that there&amp;rsquo;s probably close to a million users of Obsidian and only basically five core members of the team. And eventually, from a support standpoint are things, things might start to break and we might need to hire people to help on that front. But we&amp;rsquo;re trying to stay small if we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Yeah. I think you&amp;rsquo;ve been very diplomatic about the VC thing. I mean, in general it&amp;rsquo;s, you know, you&amp;rsquo;ve got, in my coaching practice, and I coach a lot of design leaders who are kind of suffering in startups or scale ups because of this constant pressure to scale, because this constant pressure for just more and you know, I want a 10 X on my, you know, investors want 10 X return on their investment in some stupid amount of time, things like that. And it definitely leads to that, you know, what Cory, Dr. Al calls sort of, an end certification, you know, this thing where then there&amp;rsquo;s a choke point and we have everyone&amp;rsquo;s data on our server and they have to use app and then you just start, it becomes a sort of process of trying to extract value. And I-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve touched on the thing-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Oh, go on, go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: To defend VC, I will say there&amp;rsquo;s some businesses where, it kind of is necessary because especially, we&amp;rsquo;re in a privileged position, building software, because software has no cost to us. But there&amp;rsquo;s some companies, you know, that have to produce a physical product in the world-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan:: And they have to buy the materials and put in orders and so they need to raise money somehow, and VC is one of those paths. You can get loans, like, there&amp;rsquo;s different ways. So I think it, I&amp;rsquo;m not like, I just have a kind of, like, a more zen point of view on that where like, I understand why a lot of companies go that direction and it makes sense. I think in the case of what we&amp;rsquo;re trying to build specifically, it&amp;rsquo;s a bad fit. But it&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily a bad fit for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: So-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: You mentioned anything just now which is, oh sorry, Nicole. What were you gonna say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sharing-obsidian-sync-obsidian-publish&#34;&gt;Sharing, Obsidian Sync, Obsidian Publish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: I was gonna say I&amp;rsquo;d like to go back to, and just quickly, to what Obsidian is bad at. And you know, Stephan, I love Obsidian. It is, I&amp;rsquo;m all for it. I am possibly the biggest fan. I think one thing that Obsidian is bad at that I really would love to see improved, is sharing. Because I think that is the thing that stops most people from using it, because, you know, using it on your own in an isolated way is one thing. It excels at that. But anytime that you have other people that you wanna do that with, as an example, Andy and I play D&amp;amp;D. Okay, this not a work thing, right? But it is a recreational use, and honestly, it takes up a lot of, my usage of Obsidian is role playing games. And in that group, there are four of us, three and a half, who use Obsidian. We can&amp;rsquo;t share our notes. We can&amp;rsquo;t have like, one repository for all of us to collaborate on. So we have like, individual notes, and yes, we could use something like Dropbox to share those notes, but then Andy for example, can&amp;rsquo;t, or wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to share all of his notes with us. Maybe some of them he would. So I would love to see like, a little bit more permissions around sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah, I think sharing is a big, like, it&amp;rsquo;s a challenge because there&amp;rsquo;s like, three or four different use cases nested under sharing that are quite different from one another. So, we have published, so we&amp;rsquo;re doing a lot of work right now, actually, on making some publish improvements. There&amp;rsquo;s a big batch of publish improvements that just went live like, a week or two ago, and that&amp;rsquo;s more about sharing to the external world, an entire vault, and we wanna keep improving that. Then there is sync, which is like, has this concept called Shared Vaults. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if you&amp;rsquo;ve tried that out, but Sync Shared Vaults is actually what we use internally on the Obsidian team. So everyone who&amp;rsquo;s like, you know, between the five of us, are working on projects, we keep our notes in one shared vault. Then there&amp;rsquo;s also the idea of, &amp;ldquo;Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this note, I just wanna send a link to someone so that they can view it.&amp;rdquo; They don&amp;rsquo;t have Obsidian or they don&amp;rsquo;t know, you know, I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna like, put them through the process of having to, you know, learn everything about Obsidian just to read this one note. And that note might be, you know, semi-private, like, it&amp;rsquo;s like, something where it&amp;rsquo;s not like, a published use case where you want the world to see it, you just want this one person to see it. And then there&amp;rsquo;s a collaboration use case where like, Google Docs or Notion makes it really easy for a few people to be like, collaboratively editing something, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t, or have Obsidian, for example. So like, those are all kind of different problems to solve in different ways, and I do think that we want to find ways to solve those problems, figuring out what the right order, that&amp;rsquo;s another challenge about being a small team is like, what do we work on now versus later? But I think all of them are problems that we would like to solve, you know, over the kind of medium to long term for sure. We&amp;rsquo;re very aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: It feels like there&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a thread here, though, as well, when you&amp;rsquo;ve talked about, you know, &amp;lsquo;cause obviously the sharing bit brings up the privacy issue that you talked about before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Correct. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: And it also links to the, is there a browser-based version of Obsidian? You know, because one of the ways of obviously, easily sharing and collaborating on a document would be to have kind of a browser-based editor, even if it was just for that one document. And it&amp;rsquo;s almost like, you need a kind of, instead of a separate vault, a sort of enclave in your existing vault that you can say, &amp;ldquo;Oh this the shareable bit and all the rest of it, you know, remains encrypted,&amp;rdquo; let&amp;rsquo;s say, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if the encryption thing is an issue, but you know, at some point once you share it, you have to not do that, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: So I think-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: And that may be at the beginning of the browser-based version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: I think my problem is that I am able to do those use cases, but I use separate tools for each of them. I would really love to streamline in this area. Like you were talking about, being able to share a link. I use Etherpad with that, but it&amp;rsquo;s not the best. It works, though. And then when you talk about using Sync, I also subscribe to Sync, but that also requires other people to have Sync. So for those people who don&amp;rsquo;t use Obsidian enough to warrant Sync, I use Dropbox. And then at work, because we have all of our internal docs on GitHub repos, I use GitHub to bring my Obsidian notes and share them. And that brings a lot of things but also brings like, comments and being able to roll back changes, and, you know, handle merge conflicts, and that&amp;rsquo;s not something that Sync does as well for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: I totally agree. Yeah, I think that those are things that we have to eventually solve. And I do, going back to what feels like it should be a core thing and what feels like it should be a community thing, I think that sharing is something that belongs in core, or at least core needs to have good sharing mechanisms for all of the different use cases. Publishing, collaboration, single note sharing, is just a matter of, how do we do that? In what order do we build those features? And can we build them in a way that is consistent with our principles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-management-in-obsidian&#34;&gt;Task management in Obsidian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Can we talk about task management? &amp;lsquo;Cause that was something that was on the roadmap. So is there anything you can share with us on that front?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Our goal around that one is fairly conservative, I would say. It&amp;rsquo;s not gonna be a major, you know, complete revamp to everything. It&amp;rsquo;s more about, how do we make tasks queriable in a better way, like, and also adding better date supports? So we&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about how do due dates work with tasks? So right now, there&amp;rsquo;s ways that you can do that with community plugins, but we wanna figure out, should there be a core way of dealing with due dates? Again, thinking about the API first and how that might, you know, enable developers to come up with some new experiences on top of that. But I would say that that project&amp;rsquo;s been a little bit on the back burner for us because, we had some other ideas that we wanted to prioritize first, like Canvas, and some of the things that we&amp;rsquo;re working on right now, like metadata and publish improvements, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: It does occur to me that a lot of these things, like task management, could be helped if you share a log something like DataCorp or DataView. &amp;lsquo;Cause the functionality is there, you just need to make it look pretty, but you&amp;rsquo;re good at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah, I mean the challenge there is just again, like, you know, two, three people building things. We only have so much bandwidth and kind of finding that happy medium between, we wanna make sure that we&amp;rsquo;re, you know, releasing features at a good pace. But every time we add new capabilities, we also add, you know, add to the surface area of potential bugs of potential issues that might come up or edge cases with certain plugins, we increase the number of feature requests, like, when we add something like Canvas, then we get a whole bunch of new feature requests from people who are like, &amp;ldquo;Oh, Canvas is great, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do X, Y or Z.&amp;rdquo; So that, I don&amp;rsquo;t know that anyone has ever solved that problem. It&amp;rsquo;s just kind of a problem of building software in the world. But, that is probably the biggest challenge that we deal with as a team is like, how to find the right balance of what to build now, how comprehensive do we want this feature to be versus, you know, starting small and kind of building on top of it. But trail locking a plugin, we tend to, we&amp;rsquo;ve done it a couple times, and when we do, we tend to rewrite it from scratch pretty much. And so that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty big effort. Like, rewriting something like DataView or Data, I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked at the code for DataCore. It&amp;rsquo;s not a small task. It tends to be a pretty big thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;artificial-intelligence-in-obsidian&#34;&gt;Artificial intelligence in Obsidian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Another question here by Imaginationscene and another one by another user called Remy, &amp;ldquo;What about AI? Or integrating something like ChatGPT?&amp;rdquo; Is that something that&amp;rsquo;s on your radar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about this. I think that right now, so this kind of like, goes back to the benefit of the extensibility of Obsidian. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that Obsidian was the first app that had ChatGPT or like GPT-3 integrated into it, because someone in the community built a plugin for that called Text Generator. And now I think there&amp;rsquo;s three or four plug-ins out there that connect to the Open AI API. So, the cool thing for Obsidian is that because it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to build plug-ins, people tend to go really like, we both have the ability to be very fast and very slow, so, the community can go and build a plugin that solves that use case. And I think that they&amp;rsquo;re quite good, actually. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Text Generator a bunch, but we can also be patient about what&amp;rsquo;s the right way of building it for Obsidian. And I think that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of companies right now rushing into adding GPT to everything. My personal preference when it comes to this, is I would like for it to all be local first, completely private. I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna send, you know, data that I don&amp;rsquo;t, like, I wanna have complete control over any data that is being sent. You know, there&amp;rsquo;s this concept of training and inference in, we&amp;rsquo;re getting like, right into the weeds of how AI works, but I would like, someday, to be able to have maybe a plugin, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a core plugin or a community plugin, that can do some training on your vault and kind of learn from your vault and be able to do the inference locally on your computer, so that it completely aligns with the principles of privacy and local first that Obsidian is known for. The challenge with that right now is that that&amp;rsquo;s quite intensive on the graphics card, and it&amp;rsquo;s quite complicated to set up locally for users, and we&amp;rsquo;re still kind of waiting to see whether a company like Stability, that they made stable diffusion and is an open-source platform for like, image generation, there&amp;rsquo;s been talks about them releasing a language model that would be open source. So we&amp;rsquo;re kind of waiting for all of those things to come together before we make a decision. We would, I think we would prefer to build something that kind of, is aligned with our principles, but in the meantime, there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of plug-ins that you can use that solve that use case and I think they do quite a good job with them, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Stephan, have you heard of &lt;a href=&#34;https://napkin.one/?via=nicole&#34;&gt;Napkin&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: No, I don&amp;rsquo;t know Napkin. Tell me more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: It&amp;rsquo;s, yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s an awesome service that I recently have been using. And it uses AI in a really interesting way, because I think there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of focus on using AI for like, generating blocks of text or outlines or images. But what Napkin does is it looks at your vault, well, it&amp;rsquo;s not a vault because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do it for Obsidian, it looks at your Readwise highlights, and it uses AI to tag them intelligently. So, it has this interface where you can determine, you can click on like, a thought or a highlight, and it shows you intelligently linked other highlights that you already have, that you may not have put together. And sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re like, they&amp;rsquo;re not even using the same keyword or they&amp;rsquo;re not tagged the same way, but somehow it still figures it out. That kind of thing would be invaluable for Obsidian because there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to be said for manually linking things, but getting some help would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: I think that sounds awesome. I&amp;rsquo;m seeing a lot of comments here in the chat of like, people who are suggesting some different ideas and some plugins that I&amp;rsquo;m not even aware of that are already doing some more local AI stuff. I think that&amp;rsquo;s a, I think what&amp;rsquo;s amazing about the Obsidian community is we have people kind of, at every level of the spectrum of nerdiness. Like, we have like, people who are some of the most advanced engineers that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever talked to are developing their own custom plugins, and then we have people who are complete beginners and novices, not engineers, people who are just learning about note taking. We have a lot of young students in the community. And so, I like that we have the ability to have those people who are like, all the way at the deepest end of like, understanding all of those principles, able to start working on, you know, potential plugins and extensions that could do something like that. And that can be kind of a breeding ground where we can learn, what do people actually want out of that type of tool? But I do think that if we want to continue to stay true to these kind of principles of being local and private, there&amp;rsquo;s gonna be some constraints that we have to deal with that are actual like, performance constraints and technical constraints, that may mean Obsidian will be a little slower to get to those features than apps that are completely cloud-based where they can upload that to a server and do that, you know, somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Hm. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: So I think it is a very tricky challenge for us to try to solve that right away. I think we&amp;rsquo;re gonna tend to watch what plugin developers do, and then start to think about that in a year or two. &amp;lsquo;Cause right now there&amp;rsquo;s, I mean, literally every month there&amp;rsquo;s something new going on with AI and the open source packages that are going on. So, we&amp;rsquo;re maybe a little less cutting edge than the plugin ecosystem can be, if that makes sense, on the core side it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: It feels like you could get dependent on something very quickly there as well, and just kind get really kind of bogged down. And then, you know, a couple of people have said keep that as a plugin, it&amp;rsquo;s much better that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;accessibility-in-obsidian&#34;&gt;Accessibility in Obsidian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: There was a question, it was from Daniel Gartmann further up yeah, I don&amp;rsquo;t use a screen reader, but I think, you know, something that would need to be much more sort of, core fundamentals as obviously accessibility. I don&amp;rsquo;t know, maybe Daniel can say how, I don&amp;rsquo;t know how accessible Obsidian is to use with screen read, but read is-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: We&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of work in that area with, yeah, I would be curious to hear a little bit more detail from Daniel about what they&amp;rsquo;re looking for, but yeah, Obsidian is already compatible with screen readers. We have done a lot of work on that side, but if there&amp;rsquo;s things that are missing in that respect, I would say let us know in the community, on the forum or on Discord. We&amp;rsquo;re definitely, I agree that building that into core is a must. I think that&amp;rsquo;s super important. We&amp;rsquo;ve added a lot of new customization features over the past year, so I&amp;rsquo;m actually kind of curious to see if there are themes that get developed that are focused on different use cases. It&amp;rsquo;s much easier today to design themes than it was a year ago in my, one of my, that was one of my biggest contributions over the past year from a code standpoint, was rewriting the way that themes can be built. And so that means that you can very easily now create like, very high-contrast themes. Themes with different font sizes, different fonts that might help people who have, you know, who need help on the vision side. But then there&amp;rsquo;s other things like, ARIA labels and other kind of web technologies that we&amp;rsquo;re able to incorporate that make it easier with screen readers for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tags-vs-links&#34;&gt;Tags vs Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Okay, we have a question that is a little bit controversial. It&amp;rsquo;s from Germ Germain, whom I actually, by chance, met a few weeks ago in person. He says, &amp;ldquo;What is his opinion (Well, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna ask both of you) about tags versus links?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: In my personal use? Or, how do you wanna clarify that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Yeah, in your personal use. Which one do you use more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: So I tend to use links more than tags, personally. So, I do have quite a few tags, but I tend to use links because I like to see everything in the, all the relationships in my backlinks, I guess, is how I would say it. And I like that links, for example, like, I&amp;rsquo;ll have a top-level categories for books that I&amp;rsquo;ve read. And so I just have a category called books. And I link to it. In my template, I still use tags. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually really know why. I just feel like I should have it there for future need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Future proofing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah, for future proofing. Like, if I ever create a note about a book, it has both a tag for book and a link to the category books. So that redundancy helps sometimes if I&amp;rsquo;m creating like a DataView list or something I have access to both of those different ways of filtering down. But I tend to prefer links. I think links have a lot, are more powerful and cross over more different things. I think tags, where I use them the most, is for kind of very narrow meta segmentation of a very specific thing, where there&amp;rsquo;s only like, a very narrow subset of notes that needs to be grouped in a way that a link wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make sense, or I don&amp;rsquo;t really wanna have a page for that concept. Am I making sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Mm hm. I&amp;rsquo;m still here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: But also, it&amp;rsquo;s not-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I&amp;rsquo;m still a fan of the folders, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Oh, I hear you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: No. Do you really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Oh, half the people have gone, &amp;ldquo;Oh god!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah. I&amp;rsquo;m very-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: What are you even doing here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: In my personal organization-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: No, I&amp;rsquo;m joking, I&amp;rsquo;m joking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I can explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: This is why I feel like Obsidian being not dogmatic about this is great, because people think in different ways. Like, I love that people can use folders or tags or links or all of them. Do whatever works for you. If it works for you, that&amp;rsquo;s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I think partly goes back to what you were saying right at the beginning, which is, you know, where the file format is the thing, right? And so I use several other things on that group of files that I have there. And whilst, you know, it&amp;rsquo;s great if you can search the tags or you can do whatever you want with the tags or links in Obsidian when you are trying to find a file, to kind of pull into something. I use Marked, Brett Terpstra&amp;rsquo;s Marked quite a lot for Output. It&amp;rsquo;s a massive pain in the ass. Well, I mean, I use search a lot anyway on the Finder, but, you know, I much prefer to have some organization that works across other things that aren&amp;rsquo;t gonna handle tags. So that&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Well, to be fair, in our team vault, we do use folders for our like, internal grouping. But I think that that use case is very different than my personal notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: We have an answer from Daniel, actually. He says he has issues both for Windows and iOS screen reader support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Okay, well let&amp;rsquo;s-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: &amp;ldquo;I love the potential that Obsidian has for me as a blind person who&amp;rsquo;s already using notes in a text-based format.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Jump into Discord and let&amp;rsquo;s talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I don&amp;rsquo;t know how accessible Discord is, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: That&amp;rsquo;s a great question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Because we might be saying jump into something that&amp;rsquo;s really terrible for you to use on Discord. So, yeah, on the forum, I&amp;rsquo;m guessing the forum-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: The forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: It runs on Discourse, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it, of the forum?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Correct, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I would imagine it&amp;rsquo;s kinda more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: If you go to obsidian.md/community, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the links there and send us your feedback. Or if you wanna just email &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:support@obsidian.md&#34;&gt;support@obsidian.md&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look. But the best is definitely through the community and we&amp;rsquo;ll definitely take a look, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Tell us who does that email go to? Of the three of you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Well, right now it&amp;rsquo;s like, a kind of a shared thing where you kind of look in there, but I think that most people who use the support inbox are for kind of like, our enterprise users. We prefer to use the community as the main place because there&amp;rsquo;s more transparency around that and like, other people can jump in and add their own kind of experiences with whatever the feature request or bug might be. So in general, that&amp;rsquo;s why we kind of direct people towards the community if they wanna provide some feature requests or bug fix requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I was kind of hoping it triggered like, a kind of a bat signal that projected us an Obsidian sort of into the sky, the Obsidian crystal into the sky, and you all kinda come running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah, unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s just one of those other things that, as we scale up, we have to find good ways of parsing what the community is looking for and how we can fit it into our roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;message-to-the-community&#34;&gt;Message to the community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t, I would love to have you stay, both of you, stay on for longer. You&amp;rsquo;re both welcome back, but I also wanna be mindful of your time. So thank you for coming on to talk about the future of Obsidian, Stephan, and for helping me interview him, Andy. Stephan, is there anything that you&amp;rsquo;d like to say to the community before we end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Wow. Thank you. I just, I&amp;rsquo;m so thankful. I think that the thing that I love about Obsidian is, so many smart people and kind and like, kind people are part of the community. I love, you know, watching your videos, Nicole. You do such a great job of kind of making Obsidian feel more accessible. And I think that, in a way, like, beyond what we&amp;rsquo;re working on in terms of features and so on, like, the fact that we have such a friendly and collaborative and helpful community, is one of my favorite things. And so, I&amp;rsquo;m extremely thankful for that. You know, continue to be, continue doing an amazing job, being nice and helpful. Like, I think we&amp;rsquo;re still at the very beginning of people adopting these tools. Like, anyone who&amp;rsquo;s watching this is probably in the like, top 0.01% of people who knows anything about these, whatever you wanna call &amp;rsquo;em, tools for thought, how you like, some people have been calling it integrated thinking environment. Like, we&amp;rsquo;re creating a new generation of tools that help people unlock the way that they think. And anyone who&amp;rsquo;s watching this right now is kind of, pretty much on the cutting edge of that concept. And I&amp;rsquo;m really curious what happens if that idea becomes more pervasive in society. I&amp;rsquo;m very hopeful that it can help us solve a lot of big problems. And so, if you&amp;rsquo;re one of the, you know, nerds, I say that lovingly. Geeks, dorks, that are part of this conversation, I consider myself one of those, introducing people to Obsidian and being part of, you know, helping them learn how to kind of, make their thought process more reliable is just an amazing gift. Like, I just think that&amp;rsquo;s like, and you&amp;rsquo;re doing that every day with your videos, Nicole. And so, I wanna thank you for that. So that, it&amp;rsquo;s not a specific ask, but that&amp;rsquo;s just kind of the way that I feel and I hope we can continue that for a really long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Awesome. Thank you. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk to you both in a second, but we&amp;rsquo;ll say goodbye to everybody else. Thank you for joining us on this weekend, and see you next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Thanks. Bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Bye!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some AI tools for learning and taking notes that I&amp;rsquo;ve incorporated into my processes. AI is a controversial topic, but it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember it&amp;rsquo;s just like any other technology: it&amp;rsquo;s only as good as the people that wield it. In this video, I show some ways I use artificial intelligence to improve my learning and note-taking rather than to replace them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about my top 10 core plugins in Obsidian: the built-in options that improve your productivity without adding clutter and complexity to your notes. Unlike community plugins, core plugins are a lower security risk, yet provide a lot of extra value&amp;ndash; but they&amp;rsquo;re also easy to overlook. Here are my favourite underappreciated core plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an overview of Obsidian: what it is, why everyone&amp;rsquo;s using it, and how to get started with Obsidian for beginners with a brand new course called Obsidian for Everyone. I&amp;rsquo;m extremely proud of the course and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to share it with you after working on it for what seems like forever. It contains everything you need to know to use Obsidian &amp;ndash; but without installing any third-party community plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My time management setup in Obsidian consists of a way to set goals, a daily note for rapid logging the present, and a review/retrospective system to evaluate past performance. In this video, I talk about all the plugins and apps I use to get all my responsibilities done&amp;ndash; without me feeling like I&amp;rsquo;m overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20221230-taking-notes-from-youtube-videos-in-obsidian/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about five different ways to take notes on YouTube videos in Obsidian, for those (like me) who love learning things on YouTube and want a way to capture new thoughts in Obsidian. I mention a few community plugins, a browser extension, and a separate service as well as my workflow for just using vanilla Obsidian, so you can take your pick!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mastobot: a Mastodon Bot for Readwise and Obsidian</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20221225-mastodon-bot-for-readwise-and-obsidian/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 25 Dec 2022 00:31:28 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20221225-mastodon-bot-for-readwise-and-obsidian/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a love affair with &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/nicole&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt; for a while, enough to write some code to extend it. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210206-readwise-to-obsidian/&#34;&gt;wrote a Python script to save Readwise highlights to my Obsidian vault&lt;/a&gt;, switched to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210810-readwise-to-obsidian-redux/&#34;&gt;Readwise Official plugin&lt;/a&gt; when they released it, &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210815-shortform-to-readwise/&#34;&gt;wrote another script sending Shortform highlights to Readwise&lt;/a&gt;, and then was happy when the two companies established an official integration thanks to me introducing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I should have learned to just be patient and wait for the awesome Readwise team to build integrations I want, but remembered I&amp;rsquo;m not that patient. This is about how I created a Mastodon bot to send Mastodon posts I like to my Readwise account, and, by extension, to my &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md/&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might say there&amp;rsquo;s a pattern here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-problem&#34;&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been dabbling in &lt;a href=&#34;https://joinmastodon.org/&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt; for a while, but only recently got extremely involved with it when I decided to start and maintain a Mastodon server, &lt;a href=&#34;https://pkm.social&#34;&gt;pkm.social&lt;/a&gt;, for the personal knowledge management community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readwise already has an awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Rw1L5sxlnuU?t=400&#34;&gt;Twitter integration&lt;/a&gt; that I really enjoyed. Basically, once you&amp;rsquo;ve set it up, sending any tweet to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/readwise&#34;&gt;@readwise&lt;/a&gt; adds it to your Readwise account. This means that whenever someone says something actually meaningful or interesting on Twitter, I can make sure it gets sent to Readwise, and then from there to my notes in Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted the same setup for Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-result&#34;&gt;The result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the end result: I managed to get Mastodon posts I send to my bot to be sent to my Readwise account. Here are some early posts in the &amp;ldquo;Tweets&amp;rdquo; section of my Readwise Library:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/mastodon-on-readwise.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are the resulting notes in Obsidian, also automatically synced and formatted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/mastodon-in-obsidian.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-solution&#34;&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, here&amp;rsquo;s how to set it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pre-requisites&#34;&gt;Pre-requisites&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need a few things to get started:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Mastodon account (I use and co-host &lt;a href=&#34;https://pkm.social&#34;&gt;pkm.social&lt;/a&gt; for free)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Readwise account (&lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/nicole&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an affiliate link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with GitHub, the command line, Node.js (although I&amp;rsquo;m not a Node.js developer, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be, either)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The willingness/ability to leave a Node.js script running on a server somewhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;setup&#34;&gt;Setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clone &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/mastobot&#34;&gt;my Mastobot repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In your Mastodon account settings, go to the Development section for your Mastodon server (e.g. &lt;code&gt;https://pkm.social/settings/applications&lt;/code&gt;) and click New Application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill in the application name (this can be anything you want), leave everything else the same, and then click Save Changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on the application you just created, and note your client key, client secret, and access token. You&amp;rsquo;ll need these later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In this repository, copy the contents of &lt;code&gt;.env.sample&lt;/code&gt; to a new file called &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;ACCESS_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;CLIENT_SECRET&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;CLIENT_KEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;READWISE_TOKEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;DOMAIN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fill out the fields in &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; with the information you just obtained from your Mastodon account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the &lt;code&gt;READWISE_TOKEN&lt;/code&gt; field, enter your &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/access_token&#34;&gt;Readwise access token&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the &lt;code&gt;DOMAIN&lt;/code&gt; field, enter your Mastodon server&amp;rsquo;s domain (e.g. &lt;code&gt;https://pkm.social&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; to install the dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;node bot.js&lt;/code&gt; to start the bot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Mastodon, find a post you like and reply to it with &lt;code&gt;@accountname Your comment here.&lt;/code&gt; Within a few minutes, the original post you replied to will be sent to your Readwise account as a highlight and your comment as a note.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;limitations&#34;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This workflow is not without its limitations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to keep the script running somewhere to be able to use it. I considered using a polling approach, but decided I wanted to experiment with Mastodon&amp;rsquo;t streaming API, which would also be more responsive, so I went with that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right now, because the bot takes environment variables about &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; particular setup, it&amp;rsquo;s not as versatile as the official Twitter implementation. As it is, it&amp;rsquo;s for one person&amp;rsquo;s use only.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It uses the &amp;ldquo;Tweets&amp;rdquo; category in Readwise, which is not ideal, but I can&amp;rsquo;t really do anything about that until they give Mastodon its own category. This isn&amp;rsquo;t really a big deal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right now, the bot doesn&amp;rsquo;t support images or other media embedded to posts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I may address some of these issues, but for now, I&amp;rsquo;m just happy with the result. I fully expect that the Readwise team will eventually be able to flesh this out into a more robust integration, so I&amp;rsquo;m hesitant to spend too much more effort now that I&amp;rsquo;ve got it doing the minimum of what I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;resources&#34;&gt;Resources&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in doing this for yourself, here are some resources that might be useful:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Visual atomic note taking in Obsidian can be a great complement to taking notes in text form if you use tools like the Obsidian Excalidraw plugin. Obsidian Excalidraw lets you link and backlink with images, tag them for querying later, and even embed images AND parts of images. It&amp;rsquo;s an essential part of taking notes visually while not missing out on the benefits of plain text.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading on a Kindle can be more convenient than reading paperbacks because you can import your Kindle highlights and notes into Obsidian or your note-taking app of choice. Here are some tips for making the most out of every book you read.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Obsidian Canvas Core Plugin (new in v1.0.0)</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20221209-obsidian-canvas-core-plugin/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20221209-obsidian-canvas-core-plugin/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The new Obsidian Canvas core plugin was introduced recently in v1.1.0, currently available only to Insiders but soon available to everyone. Canvas is an optional plugin that gives Obsidian an infinitely scrolling space to arrange notes, media, and other cards (potentially including external websites). If you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scrintal.com/&#34;&gt;Scrintal&lt;/a&gt;, this core plugin brings some of the same visual thinking workflows to Obsidian, which I think is a very smart step.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you go about making notes actually useful? Using notes well entails taking good notes in the first place, processing them, and then creating something new out of them. In this video, I talk about the plugins that I use in every stage of the process, and some guidelines for how I actually make a note on something I&amp;rsquo;ve learned into content that I (and others) can make use of.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Notion-like Content Calendar in Obsidian Projects</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20221118-notion-like-content-calendar-in-obsidian-projects/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20221118-notion-like-content-calendar-in-obsidian-projects/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to create a content calendar in Obsidian just like in Notion, the new Obsidian Projects plugin presents new options for managing content using multiple views: Table, Board, Calendar, and Gallery to start with, but hopefully more in the future. Projects is a framework for creating new views for the same data and aims to play well with other plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The more notes you have, the more you might wonder if you should have multiple vaults in Obsidian. There is no definitive answer, but in this video, I talk about reasons you should have only one vault as well as good reasons to have several vaults, based on my own experience. Like with anything I say, take what&amp;rsquo;s useful and do what makes sense!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted rotating Notion database views in Obsidian? Marcus Olsson&amp;rsquo;s Obsidian Projects plugin does exactly that, letting you create Table, Board, Calendar, and Gallery views for the same notes in Obsidian, just like in Notion! Join us as Marcus shows us how this awesome new plugin works and how it can be used to display the same data in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wondering how to organize your notes in Obsidian? In this video, I talk about some methods in Obsidian for imposing structure and organization, the LATCH method for adding data to your data, and which methods I would use in Obsidian for each part of LATCH (Location, Alphabet, Time, Category, and Hierarchy). This is not meant to be a definitive or prescriptive guide for how YOU should organize your notes. Instead, take this as a look into how I prefer to do it, in the hopes that you may find inspiration for how you&amp;rsquo;d like to do it as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taking Better Notes From Books: Shortform-Readwise-Obsidian</title>

      <description>
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JfL9iAEfSCg&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;https://shortform.com/nicole&#34;&gt;Shortform&lt;/a&gt; for over a year. I&amp;rsquo;ve written &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/shortform-to-readwise&#34;&gt;some code&lt;/a&gt; for it and I&amp;rsquo;ve also written &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210815-shortform-to-readwise/&#34;&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it. It&amp;rsquo;s an essential part of my workflow for taking better notes from books, particularly in conjunction with &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/nicole&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt; and my current note-taking tool of choice, &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md/&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s what you need to know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-shortform&#34;&gt;What is Shortform?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortform is a service that creates book summaries out of popular books, but it&amp;rsquo;s also so much more than that! They&amp;rsquo;re like Netflix but for books, if you can imagine that. The summaries that Shortform gives you are not just your typical high school level summaries of a book report that we used to do when we were younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-makes-shortform-different&#34;&gt;What makes Shortform different?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are things that differentiate Shortform from other book summary services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;researched-commentary&#34;&gt;Researched commentary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortform has really thoughtful and nuanced commentary that place it firmly head and shoulders above other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot of some Shortform commentary from the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3gO0gmP&#34;&gt;Why We Sleep&lt;/a&gt;, taken on the Shortform mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/shortform-why-we-sleep.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Shortform commentary from the book &amp;amp;ldquo;Why We Sleep&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlighted section is a Shortform note&amp;ndash; additional commentary that the Shortform team added. In this case, they are fact-checking the author, citing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sleep.pitt.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-AASM-Manual-for-Scoring-of-Sleep-and-Associated-Events-2007-.pdf&#34;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; that prove a statement the author made to be false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was reading this book, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really think about questioning those claims. But Shortform thoroughly goes over every claim that Walker, the author, made in thsi book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading with Shortform is like having somebody else read a book with you&amp;ndash; a more critical and more well-informed someone who has the time to fact-check statements. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like having your own personal book club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;shortform-vs-blinkist&#34;&gt;Shortform vs. Blinkist&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another service in this vein that I&amp;rsquo;ve used is &lt;a href=&#34;https://blinkist.com/&#34;&gt;Blinkist&lt;/a&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the same book in Shortform and Blinkist to figure out why I like Shortform so much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the Blinkist summary for the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3W8rFQH&#34;&gt;Indistractable&lt;/a&gt; looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/blinkist-indistractable-summary.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Blinkist summary of Indistractable&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blinkist is based on the idea that every book can be distilled into these &lt;em&gt;blinks&lt;/em&gt;: very short summaries of every idea. For this book it has eight. Each of these blinks is a few paragraphs long. Here&amp;rsquo;s what the first looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/blinkist-indistractable-first-section.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Blinkist&amp;amp;rsquo;s Indistractable blink&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blink is a straight summary. There&amp;rsquo;s no commentary. There&amp;rsquo;s no research or anything like that. It seems like the whole focus of this is to be able to distill exactly what the author has said and let other people do the work of trying to figure out for themselves whether something is true or not. There&amp;rsquo;s really not much more than just these blinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, if we look at the one on Shortform, this is the same book and it also has like a one page summary like Blinkist did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/shortform-indistractable-summary.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Shortform summary of Indistractable&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then it also has a full book guide, which goes through every single chapter or part and adds more detail into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/shortform-indistractable-first-section.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Shorform&amp;amp;rsquo;s Indistractable first part&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, Shortform takes a different approach: instead of just summarizing the book, they&amp;rsquo;re truly trying to explain it in their own unique way, providing examples and making it more readable using bullet points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;action-oriented-exercises&#34;&gt;Action-oriented exercises&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortform also has these exercises based on the things that the author has said in the book. These exercises are peppered throughout and between these chapters, and they really force you to put things into practice right away as soon as you learn them, which is another element of learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/shortform-indistractable-exercises.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of an exercise in Shortform&amp;amp;rsquo;s Indistractable summary&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;critical-thinking-comparisons-to-other-ideas&#34;&gt;Critical thinking: comparisons to other ideas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortform tries to examine ideas in the context of other books they&amp;rsquo;ve made summaries for. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of a Shortform note where Shortform suggests the summary of the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3NdqE5C&#34;&gt;How to Stop Worrying and Start Living&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/shortform-indistractable-comparison.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Shortform note connecting Indistractable to another book&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fans of the Zettelkasten method will be happy to see this, because Shortform often prompts me to consider the differences or similarities between ideas from different authors. It helps me see connections I might not have considered. Incidentally, I&amp;rsquo;ve also found many good books this way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-use-shortform-with-obsidian&#34;&gt;How to use Shortform with Obsidian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing that really sells it for me is the integration. Because I don&amp;rsquo;t want that learning to stop in the Shortform app. You know me, and I want everything in Obsidian. And Shortform has an integration that Blinkist does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually tried to solve this problem myself a year ago, because no integration existed. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210815-shortform-to-readwise/&#34;&gt;wrote a Python script&lt;/a&gt; that would take the Shortform highlights, because it has an API, and then call the Readwise API and kind of string them together. Now, that still works as far as I know, but that&amp;rsquo;s not what I recommend anymore. I talked to the Readwise founders and suggested to them that Shortform was a great company to partner with. Not too long after that, they came out with &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/changelog/shortform-import&#34;&gt;an awesome integration&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, sign up to both &lt;a href=&#34;https://shortform.com/nicole&#34;&gt;Shortform&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/nicole&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt;. They both have free trials, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to commit to anything just yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/welcome/sync#shortform&#34;&gt;click on this link to connect&lt;/a&gt; your Readwise account to Shortform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(optional) If you use Obsidian like I do, &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210810-readwise-to-obsidian-redux/&#34;&gt;follow these instructions&lt;/a&gt; to install the Readwise Official plugin for Obsidian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s pretty much it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on, here&amp;rsquo;s how things will work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You make highlights on books on Shortform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those highlights are sent to Readwise automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through the Readwise official plugin, those highlights get synced into your Obsidian vault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-result-shortform-highlights-in-obsidian&#34;&gt;The result: Shortform highlights in Obsidian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what my Shortform highlights look like in Obsidian. Note that after setting this up, all I had to do was make highlights on Shortform&amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s quite low-touch after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-shortform-indistractable.png&#34; alt=&#34;Shorform highlights synced to Obsidian vault via Readwise&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tweaked the export settings in Readwise to set the format I want the note to have in Obsidian. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to do this, but if you want to, you can change those settings &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/export/obsidian/preferences&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-shortform-workflow-for-taking-notes-on-books&#34;&gt;My Shortform workflow for taking notes on books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty much how a lot of my book-buying and -reading goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I start by browsing books on Shortform and read the one-page summaries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I find one I like, I buy the book on Kindle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I make highlights on the Kindle version. (Those are synced to Obsidian too!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I really like the book, I flip back to the Shortform detailed chapter summaries as I finish each chapter, because they provide more context. I make highlights and notes from Shortform here sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes I do the Shortform exercises too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After I finish the book, I go back to the Shortform summary and make more highlights/notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After I&amp;rsquo;ve read my fill of both the Shortform summary and the book itself, I go back to Obsidian and write my own notes that combine what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds like a lot, it is! But keep in mind that I don&amp;rsquo;t do this for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; book. At every step of the way, Shortform helps me filter out books that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to read, or don&amp;rsquo;t want to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortform definitely saves me money: it costs less than a book a month and it stops me from reading more than one book a month. From that perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s already worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more than that, the thoughtfulness of the summaries and the research that goes into those commentaries save me more than just money: &lt;em&gt;they save me time&lt;/em&gt;. And that&amp;rsquo;s really what I keep coming back for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;related&#34;&gt;Related&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210810-readwise-to-obsidian-redux/&#34;&gt;The easiest way to sync Kindle highlights to Obsidian - Readwise to Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about how to get started with Obsidian for non-coders, specifically tackling topics like what Markdown is and how to use it to write notes in Obsidian. I also talk about some Obsidian-specific syntax that help you do things like embed Obsidian notes, create footnotes, and create queries to find the right note.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Introducing: Tabs in Obsidian v1.0! Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s latest release brings tab functionality to Obsidian, further adding to its flexibility in terms of letting us build workspaces the way we want. We can now have tabs in Obsidian and use them the way we would browser tabs. This release also came with some improvements for themes and the overall Obsidian UI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this real use case for Obsidian, I use plugins like Dataview, Database Folder, QuickAdd, Templater, and Buttons to create a database in Obsidian to track Kickstarter projects I&amp;rsquo;ve backed. I show two approaches to creating a database and demonstrate a relatively new plugin, Database Folder, which shows a lot of promise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I demonstrate how I learn Swedish in 30 days using Obsidian and other apps. Learning foreign languages is never easy, but having a system in place definitely makes the process easier. The Obsidian Spaced Repetition plugin in particular helps create flashcards that I can use on my laptop or mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I demonstrate how to use the ExcaliBrain Obsidian plugin and what it can be used for. ExcaliBrain is a very powerful plugin, and it can significantly improve your Obsidian workflows. I also mention go through installing and getting started with ExcaliBrain at four different levels of uses for it: letting it infer relationships, setting explicit relationships, creating custom relationships, and finally creating semantic relationships in ExcaliBrain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I demonstrate how to take notes from a book (The Culture Map) using Obsidian. In the process of taking notes, I also create learning exhaust in the form of notes, an atomic essay to go on Twitter, a visual that summarises a concept, and a video presentation. Taking notes from books is more than just understanding what the author wanted to say; it should also involve consolidation and interrogation of the book&amp;rsquo;s ideas into our personal knowledge management systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I demonstrate how to make your notes visual with visual PKM plugins like Excalidraw, Excalibrain, Advanced Slides, and Mind Map.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I share how to use maps in Obsidian using the Obsidian Leaflet and Kanban plugins, specifically for planning a move to another country. Using a map and marking places on it is a great way to keep track of your exploration of a country when you&amp;rsquo;re not quite sure where to live yet!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What do you do with all those notes? In this presentation, I talk about how to create things with your notes. I demonstrate my process of going from raw notes to this very presentation and share some of my strategies for creating output with little effort by learning in public and identifying topics to create content about using existing notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 19th, I did a talk at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20220519-use-it-or-lose-it/&#34;&gt;Linking Your Thinking Conference&lt;/a&gt; about using your notes (or losing them), and about what we can do to make something useful of all our notes. This was my run through!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know you can create a visual map of content in Obsidian to consolidate your notes? The Excalidraw plugin by Zsolt Viczian can be used to create a dashboard in Obsidian, take sketchnotes instead of text notes, express your ideas visually, and many more. Maps of content are useful for bottom-up thinking, and having a visual representation of your notes can inspire you to consider other perspectives or communicate your ideas in a clearer way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Obsidian Advanced Slides plugin is a great way to create presentations as code (or notes) from right inside your Obsidian vault. Using this plugin has helped me reduce the friction and the time between creating something and sharing it, whether that&amp;rsquo;s a presentation, a coding project, a video, or a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I spoke at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://lu.ma/3m1fh781&#34;&gt;Linking Your Thinking&lt;/a&gt; conference about what I do with notes I take, and how I manage to use them to actually create stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Real People Process Notes</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220512-how-real-people-process-notes/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a glaring gap in most productivity systems: time. How do REAL people, with real jobs and obligations, find the time to process notes? Is Inbox Zero an achievable and sustainable goal? I think the answer is no. In this video, I talk about what to do instead, and what is a healthier way to look at productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Getting Things Done methodology is showing its age now, but there are still some parts of it that can be updated and used in the digital age. In this video, I talk about how to actually get things done with Obsidian using the Obsidian community plugin called Checklist.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever wanted to use Obsidian for managing your tasks? In this video, I demonstrate one way to consolidate tasks from all your notes and show them on the date they&amp;rsquo;re due, using DataviewJS. Obsidian Dataview is a community plugin that can be used to show a task list.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What even IS Obsidian Dataview? Dataview has quickly become one of the most popular plugins for Obsidian, but how do you actually use it? Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a non-programmer or an expert coder, here&amp;rsquo;s how to use the Obsidian Dataview plugin and some common use cases for it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Notion and Obsidian are similar in many ways, but they have a fundamental difference in philosophy and the way they structure notes. In this video, I talk about structure as well as Notion databases vs. Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s Dataview plugin, and tell you why I ultimately ended up with Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New in Obsidian: Obsidian Callouts (available now)</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220330-new-in-obsidian-obsidian-callouts/</link>

      <description>
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TqYQ0kA1yAo&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transcript:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from writing technical documentation in the last few years is that good writing is skimmable, at least in the digital age. So since I look at my notes in Obsidian the same way as I do a sort of personal documentation, I think that a lot of the same principles apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I wanna talk about an early access feature that the Obsidian team rolled out two weeks ago, and it&amp;rsquo;s called Callouts. So before I demonstrate this, I want to say that this is only available right now in the Insider Build version 0.14, but that build always gets pushed to the public, it&amp;rsquo;s just a little bit ahead of the public release. So think of this as a bit of a sneak preview. &lt;em&gt;(Note: Obsidian callouts is &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Use+callouts&#34;&gt;out now&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-obsidian-admonition&#34;&gt;What about Obsidian Admonition?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before Obsidian Callouts was released, I was using something called Obsidian Admonition. So if we go here, I can bring up my Obsidian Admonition page, and it looked something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would do three backticks. That&amp;rsquo;s kind of the code block syntax. And you would do something like add note. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;d have a title here, like reminder, and then you&amp;rsquo;d have your note here. And because I have Live Preview turned on, if I enter out of this, it&amp;rsquo;s going to look like this. So this is what Obsidian Admonition always looked like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in general, the idea here is that to make your writing more skimmable, you have these kind of, well, callout boxes that highlight sections of your text and make sure that they address something that is about the notes that you&amp;rsquo;re writing, kind of like meta notes, they&amp;rsquo;re notes about your notes, but because they&amp;rsquo;re visually distinguished from the rest of the text, it&amp;rsquo;s a lot easier for you or for your readers to easily figure out whether something is important to read or only in specific situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;admonitioncallout-example&#34;&gt;Admonition/callout example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that happens a lot in technical documentation, so it&amp;rsquo;s no secret that I have used it a lot in sort of programming kind of notes. So if we go back to my vault here, let&amp;rsquo;s look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/g&#34;&gt;my note on g&lt;/a&gt;. g is a package manager for Go, the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s a type of callout or admonition that I used. And this is kind of like this page tells you how to use, what g is and how to use it. But this note, this particular callout, is kind of like an aside. It&amp;rsquo;s like, hey, just in case you get this error, here&amp;rsquo;s how to troubleshoot it. And it&amp;rsquo;s really cool that it&amp;rsquo;s hidden by, it&amp;rsquo;s collapsed by default. And you can just click on that, and then it says, oh, if you get the error, g not found, hey, maybe restart your shell session after installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that sort of callout really helps when you&amp;rsquo;re trying to quickly skim a page. So programming is certainly one use for it, and another one is tutorials in general. You know, I have this a lot for my Obsidian stuff in case I need to say that this only works for Mac or this only works for windows or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I also use it a lot in my D&amp;amp;D games. As a Dungeon Master, I have different scenarios that I may not even need to go into depending on what my players decide to do. That is the perfect task for callouts or for admonitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enter-obsidian-callouts&#34;&gt;Enter Obsidian Callouts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was using this admonitions format with a code block for, basically, since I learned about it. It is made by a TTRPG plugin developer called Jeremy Valentine, and he&amp;rsquo;s made a lot of very popular ones, like the Dice Roller and the Initiative Tracker and Leaflet, and it just goes on and on. But I&amp;rsquo;m digressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plugin was apparently so good that even the Obsidian team realized that it really should be part of Obsidian, because a key part of Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s functionality is documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the big release is that they&amp;rsquo;ve now incorporated Admonitions-like functionality into core Obsidian, not a core plugin, so it&amp;rsquo;s not something that you even have to install or enable, it just ships by default with Obsidian, which is really awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-use-obsidian-callouts&#34;&gt;How to use Obsidian Callouts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s look into how to use it. I&amp;rsquo;m going to go to my Obsidian Callouts page here. And the syntax is a little bit different from the admonitions one. Instead of the code blocks with the three backticks, this callouts functionality now uses blockquotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;[!info] Your title
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;The contents of your note here
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you do a single blockquote like an arrow, and then you do brackets, and then an exclamation point. And then there are a bunch of different types, which we&amp;rsquo;ll get into, but the most common one, I guess, is note. Then you would put your title here, and then you can put the rest of the note here. So this is now doing it as a blockquote. And if I exit out of that, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that it has a nice icon of a kinda pencil or pen there, and it is visually distinguished from the rest of the note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;types-of-callouts&#34;&gt;Types of Callouts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;note&#34;&gt;note&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s go into the types, &amp;lsquo;cause there are a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one I already showed you, this is a note. I put this within code blocks just to show you the syntax. And then this is what it looks like. Basically, this is the standard format of callouts, you just change whatever&amp;rsquo;s here. And then you always put the title outside of the brackets, and then the content of the note below it. So this is what a note looks like. That&amp;rsquo;s probably the most common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract-summary-tldr&#34;&gt;abstract, summary, tldr&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then another one is abstract, summary, or TLDR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, all of these are the same, so like this is a TLDR, so I can actually edit it here as well. So here in this case, I was using TLDR, but if I do abstract, it&amp;rsquo;s going to look, actually, it looks a little bit different now that I think about it I thought it was going to look the same, but it&amp;rsquo;s also dependent on the theme that you&amp;rsquo;re using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so these three are actually different, even though they&amp;rsquo;re semantically the same. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s interesting. I just literally found that out right now as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;info-todo&#34;&gt;info, todo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s info and todo. So this I believe is the todo. And if I go to info, it looks slightly different, just has a little eye here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I use for descriptions. What we call it in TTRPG is what we call box text, when players enter a new scene and there&amp;rsquo;s a part that you read out word for word, rather than improvising it. This is what I use for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tip-hint-important&#34;&gt;tip, hint, important&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you have tips, hint, tip, hint, or important. This one is a tip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see what important looks like. All right. Yeah, all right. So there&amp;rsquo;s some highlighting going on there as well, and it&amp;rsquo;s marked by an asterisk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;success-check-done&#34;&gt;success, check, done&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s success, check, done. I particularly like, I think it was done. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of like the todo had a checkbox. This one actually has the check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;questions-help-faq&#34;&gt;questions, help, faq&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s questions, help, or faq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;warning-caution-attention&#34;&gt;warning, caution, attention&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s warning, caution, or attention, which is what I use for errors or gotchas when you&amp;rsquo;re programming or something things that you might fall into that I want to call out, because I did fall into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fail-failure-missing&#34;&gt;fail, failure, missing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s also fail, failure, and missing. So this is all bad stuff, essentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;danger-error&#34;&gt;danger, error&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s danger, error. It looks like this with a little lightning symbol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bug&#34;&gt;bug&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s bug, which I use quite a bit when I&amp;rsquo;m reporting bugs or documenting bugs, anyway. This example, which kind of looks like abstract, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;quote-cite&#34;&gt;quote, cite&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quote, and cite, which is kind of a blockquote, except a little bit fancier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;collapsing-and-expanding-callouts&#34;&gt;Collapsing and expanding callouts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as you can see, there are a lot of different types of callouts. And aside from all of those, you can also choose whether it&amp;rsquo;s collapsed or expanded, and that&amp;rsquo;s kind of the folding behavior that I showed you earlier. So let&amp;rsquo;s just do that now as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to say bug, and I&amp;rsquo;ll say bug detected, let&amp;rsquo;s say. And this time though, where just before the title, right outside of the parenthesis for the type that I&amp;rsquo;m using, I&amp;rsquo;m going to type a minus. And I&amp;rsquo;ll put, this is a bug. And I get out of that. This is what it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is very different from this one where it&amp;rsquo;s just expanded by default, that&amp;rsquo;s a default behavior, but if you add the minus there, that means that you&amp;rsquo;re saying that this must be minimized or collapsed by default. So then you can always click on that, and look, you see what was in the text there. You can also specify that it&amp;rsquo;s always expanded by default, but it already is always expanded by default, so you don&amp;rsquo;t really have to set that, unless you&amp;rsquo;ve changed the settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;benefits-of-obsidian-callouts&#34;&gt;Benefits of Obsidian Callouts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;better-documentation&#34;&gt;Better documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is a really cool and easy way of having these different colors. I know a lot of people that have come from Notion are kind of missing some of that in Obsidian. Well, this is an easy way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ability-to-modify-callouts&#34;&gt;Ability to modify callouts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you can also change how it looks by modifying either the CSS of the theme or by selecting themes that just really use it and display it to its advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theme here that I&amp;rsquo;m using is, let me check that, because I&amp;rsquo;m sure that people will ask. This is one of the gems of the year, one of the themes that won, it&amp;rsquo;s called Primary. Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s really cool, and it&amp;rsquo;s on the light setting. This is a test vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;callouts-are-native-on-obsidian-publish&#34;&gt;Callouts are native on Obsidian Publish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one of the coolest things about this new callouts feature is that it now works natively on Obsidian Publish. So I use Obsidian Publish for my public Obsidian vault, that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Obsidian+Callouts&#34;&gt;notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;rsquo;ll be a link in the description if you want to see what that looks like. It&amp;rsquo;s basically my way of learning in public. And I select different notes to publish on there for people to see, for anybody to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for a long time, admonitions, because it&amp;rsquo;s a plugin, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t show up up there. And then there was a way to do it where you can change the CSS and then kind of do it that way, but now that callouts is in core Obsidian, you don&amp;rsquo;t even have to do that. It&amp;rsquo;s just going to work right out of the box. So all of your notes that have the Obsidian callout syntax on them will show up the same way in your Obsidian Publish site, which is really awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-did-the-format-change-from-admonition-to-callouts&#34;&gt;Why did the format change from Admonition to callouts?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you might think, this is really just a format change, right? From admonition to callout, and part of it is that. I asked about why they changed the format, and the answer was that having the blockquote format falls back to blockquotes in unsupported Markdown renderer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-format-works-better-even-if-callouts-arent-supported&#34;&gt;New format works better even if callouts aren&amp;rsquo;t supported&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for example, if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this note in an ID and IDE that doesn&amp;rsquo;t support that syntax, it&amp;rsquo;s at least still just going to look like a blockquote, which does make more sense than it looking like a code block, because you might not have code there. This is not just for code, this is for any sort of like sticky note that you wanna put on your notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;markdown-inside-blockquotes-gets-parsed&#34;&gt;Markdown inside blockquotes gets parsed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also because it just uses blockquotes, this means that all of the Markdown inside it also gets parsed, including links and embeds and even Dataview queries apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that also means that spellcheck can check it. Because if you put something in a code block, that&amp;rsquo;s kind of a signal for spellchecks not to have a look at the contents of that code block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;does-this-completely-replace-obsidian-admonition&#34;&gt;Does this completely replace Obsidian Admonition?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what happens with admonition? Because it&amp;rsquo;s been around for a while, it&amp;rsquo;s actually still up. And in fact, admonition-style code blocks will continue to work. They&amp;rsquo;re now supporting, Obsidian is now supporting both the callouts and admonition if you have admonition plugin still enabled, then you&amp;rsquo;re still going to be able to use both. So it&amp;rsquo;s not like it&amp;rsquo;s going away, but you should probably use the callout syntax going forward, just because that&amp;rsquo;s what everyone&amp;rsquo;s going to be developing based off of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;admonition-can-convert-between-formats&#34;&gt;Admonition can convert between formats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there is also another thing that admonition is going to do is it does conversion. So if you have existing code block admonitions, then those can be converted to callouts. Actually, I want to show where you can find that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you go to settings here and look at admonition, there are a bunch of settings here, but let&amp;rsquo;s look at, yeah, the conversions. You convert MSDoc admonitions to callouts, and you can convert code block admonitions to callouts as well. Now, this will modify your notes, so just be a little bit careful with it. Save a backup or do a push to Git if you save it in a Git repo like I do. But that&amp;rsquo;s what admonition is going to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;admonition-lets-you-change-callout-appearance&#34;&gt;Admonition lets you change callout appearance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in addition to that, it&amp;rsquo;s also shifted to being able to let you change the appearance of those callouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it has a bunch of functionality like, do you wanna add drop shadows? And do you want it to be collapsible by default? Because I said that it&amp;rsquo;s expanded by default, but you could change that behavior and toggle it. And then, you could still just expand it on a case-by-case basis. But if you don&amp;rsquo;t specify anything, then it&amp;rsquo;ll just say that it should be collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also the add copy button, which is actually really interesting because a lot of times that is something that I just want to copy and paste to like my players or something if I wanna paste a description or if it actually is a code block or some sort of troubleshooting thing, so I enable that. And you can set admonition colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also change the icons that are loaded there. So right now, admonition uses the Font Awesome icons. So I was showing you all of these different types of callouts, right? But those are the default ones. And admonition adds the Font Awesome ones as well. And you can even add your own types of icons. So you can load additional icons. There&amp;rsquo;s Octicons and RPG-Awesome, which sounds really interesting, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a cool effect of that is we need to do this in admonition syntax, so it&amp;rsquo;s code blocks. Let&amp;rsquo;s say, let&amp;rsquo;s just go with question. This is a question. A cool thing that you can do with admonition is you can do icon, and then choose an icon that isn&amp;rsquo;t already in there. So as an example, I happen to know that there is a Font Awesome icon that&amp;rsquo;s a cloud, so I&amp;rsquo;m just going to put cloud there and then I&amp;rsquo;m going to put, here&amp;rsquo;s the answer. If I go out there, look, now it looks like a little green cloud, so I can change everything about how it looks. This is still in the admonition syntax, though, but it functions the same way as callouts, just extended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like this for being able to give instructions and then say, you know, this is Apple-only and not for Windows. So that&amp;rsquo;s really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;should-you-keep-using-obsidian-admonition&#34;&gt;Should you keep using Obsidian Admonition?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess the question is, and this was my question when I learned about these changes, is it still worthwhile to use admonitions because of all these quality-of-life improvements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is, because, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I&amp;rsquo;m very happy that callouts is part of Obsidian now, that just made sense for an app that is so focused on notes and note-taking and documentation. You really need these different ways to take notes on your notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;custom-icons-and-admonition-types&#34;&gt;Custom icons and admonition types&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do think think that admonition is still worthwhile installing and using if you want to delve down into the specifics of this feature. So if you want different icons that make sense to you, but maybe not to other people, this is still the best way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;user-interface-for-inserting-callouts-or-admonitions&#34;&gt;User interface for inserting callouts OR admonitions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another cool thing that I didn&amp;rsquo;t show, let me show that now, is maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t want to remember the syntax with either with the blockquotes or with the code blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with admonition turned on and enable, installed and enabled, you can bring up your command pane, which for me is Command + P, and I&amp;rsquo;m gonna type in admonition, and then you can just either a callout or an admonition and a bunch of other things as well, but I&amp;rsquo;m just going to insert a callout. And if you didn&amp;rsquo;t remember what the types were, they&amp;rsquo;re all here. And this is what they&amp;rsquo;re going to look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as I mentioned, I think these, the ones that I grouped, are actually supposed to look the same without the admonition plugin, it&amp;rsquo;s just that either the admonition plugin or my theme is making them look a little bit different, but these are the standard ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then you can choose which one you want. You can have the title there. You can choose whether or not it is collapsible. It even shows you a preview. So let&amp;rsquo;s insert that. And look, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to type out any of that and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to remember any of that syntax. So that&amp;rsquo;s just a nice little upgrade that you can only get with admonitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-callouts-is-available-now&#34;&gt;Obsidian callouts is available now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Obsidian callouts is available for all users for free now!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, Obsidian callouts, at the time of this recording, is only available in Insider Build version 0.14, which means you can only get it right now, if you need to get it right now, you&amp;rsquo;d have to pay for the Catalyst plan, which is a one-off $25 fee. I&amp;rsquo;ve paid that just because I wanted to give back to the Obsidian developers for this amazing tool that they just give for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you&amp;rsquo;re willing to wait, this feature, like all features, will soon be publicly available, Insiders just get it a little bit earlier. And when that happens, I&amp;rsquo;ll pin a comment in the comments below for this video so that you know when it&amp;rsquo;s available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn about other Obsidian plugins, I do have &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/W7kTtn9empU&#34;&gt;a video on the top 10 Obsidian plugins&lt;/a&gt;, so maybe check that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for watching!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why I Chose Obsidian Over Roam Research (as a Roam investor)</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220309-why-i-chose-obsidian-over-roam/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Mar 2022 10:03:41 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220309-why-i-chose-obsidian-over-roam/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was a Roam Research power user, a Believer, and investor before I discovered Obsidian. Here&amp;rsquo;s why I still ended up choosing Obsidian over Roam as my personal knowledge management tool of choice. My goal with this video is to share with you my reasons for making the choice that I did, not to judge you or anyone else who disagrees. In the end, we all have to decide for ourselves what tool fits best in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Top 10 Obsidian Plugins I Can&#39;t Do Without</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220223-top-10-obsidian-plugins/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 17:00:08 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220223-top-10-obsidian-plugins/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about my experience in getting started with &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, and how I went from thinking it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t meet my needs at all to not being able to shut up about how awesome it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/W7kTtn9empU&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to use Obsidian, I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it. It didn&amp;rsquo;t seem intuitive to use. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite get it to do what I wanted. And frankly, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t get all of the hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I have over 10,000 notes over multiple vaults in Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what changed? Well, it turns out that there&amp;rsquo;s a pretty crucial element of the experience that I was missing the first time around and that&amp;rsquo;s plugins. Here are my top 10 community plugins for Obsidian so that you don&amp;rsquo;t make the same mistake. \&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian already comes with some core plugins, some of which are enabled by default. Today, I&amp;rsquo;m talking about community plugins, which are extensions to Obsidian that are created by other Obsidian users. The security of your notes is still on you though so think about what you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable with before installing anything. \&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-calendar-and-fantasy-calendar&#34;&gt;Obsidian Calendar and Fantasy Calendar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 10 plugins are arranged alphabetically and the first one is Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calendar is the most popular Obsidian plugin and for a reason. I don&amp;rsquo;t know at this point why you would ever install Obsidian without the Calendar plugin because Obsidian doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a native implementation of a calendar. The Calendar plugin doesn&amp;rsquo;t just show the calendar. It also lets you create daily notes and see those daily notes over the entire month. And it also lets you create weekly reviews if you have that option enabled, which I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Calendar and this other plugin, Fantasy Calendar. Even though Fantasy Calendar definitely was made for use in a tabletop role playing game like Dungeons and Dragons, you don&amp;rsquo;t have use it as that. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Fantasy Calendar as my content calendar in Obsidian. It just provides a little bit more customization than the Calendar plugin can but I install and use both heavily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-dataview&#34;&gt;Obsidian Dataview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number two is Dataview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dataview has changed the way I use Obsidian. It&amp;rsquo;s changed the way I format my notes. It essentially allows you to define parameters and values in the YAML front matter or the metadata of your notes and then it lets you search for them. So it essentially lets you create your own database in Obsidian with custom fields for anything that you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could use it for meetings or people or tools or books that you&amp;rsquo;ve read. The possibilities are endless. By the way, in addition to the very SQL-like query language that they have, you can also use JavaScript in Dataview. There&amp;rsquo;s just so much to do with this plugin. And I really haven&amp;rsquo;t even scratched the surface of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-editor-syntax-highlight&#34;&gt;Obsidian Editor Syntax Highlight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number three is so small but so useful that I had to include it in the list. It is Editor Syntax Highlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever copied over any code into Obsidian, you may find that it lacks a little bit in readability. Editors Syntax Highlight dramatically improves readability by changing the syntax highlighting depending on the programming language that you select. It isn&amp;rsquo;t going to replace VS Code anytime soon, but if you&amp;rsquo;re like me and you use it sort of as a dev log while you&amp;rsquo;re trying figure something out and you include your final solution or the code into your note, then I think that this is a must-have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-kanban&#34;&gt;Obsidian Kanban&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number four is Kanban which is funny because I don&amp;rsquo;t even usually like the Kanban approach. I never understood Trello and I never liked Post-it Notes. I don&amp;rsquo;t use Kanban for task management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered what it&amp;rsquo;s really good for is a content calendar. I create a card in Kanban for every bit of content that I&amp;rsquo;d like to work on, whether that&amp;rsquo;s code or a section in a workshop, a blog post, a video, or really basically anything. I really like being able to create my own columns and spicing it up by embedding photos within the card itself. It just makes the whole process a lot more visual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-outliner&#34;&gt;Obsidian Outliner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number five is Outliner. Before Obsidian, I was using Roam and it definitely shows. While I&amp;rsquo;ve moved on philosophically from Roam Research, I still love the very task-oriented bulletin format that it had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Outliner brings the same thing to Obsidian. So you can have your keyboard shortcuts for quickly moving something up and down a list or indenting and unindenting as well. It has made my transition from Roam Research significantly easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-periodic-notes&#34;&gt;Obsidian Periodic Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number six is Periodic Notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think one of the most fundamental philosophical differences between Obsidian and tools like Evernote is that Obsidian doesn&amp;rsquo;t want you to just capture it all. Obsidian is about bringing those notes to the forefront, processing them, analyzing them, really learning them, and then changing them as your knowledge changes and Periodic Notes really helps with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is particularly useful for OKR or objective setting because it provides a system for reviewing notes daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to use all of those, but I find that using some of them is really useful in helping me step back and think about what I actually want to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-publish&#34;&gt;Obsidian Publish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number seven probably would be my number one if I were ranking these, but since it&amp;rsquo;s alphabetical, number seven is Obsidian Publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian Publish is a premium add-on to Obsidian that lets you instantly publish all of your notes or at least the notes that you select to be published to a certain domain. Now I have it going to a custom domain and yes, it&amp;rsquo;s not free. And yes, I do know that there are other ways that you could do this with markdown files. I have my personal blog using Hugo as a static generator for instance, but there&amp;rsquo;s just something about Publish and just it taking just a few clicks between writing something and putting it out there that really reduces the inertia for me to learn in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning in public and growing a digital garden that is constantly changing is really important to me and it has been essential to my professional and personal development. So Obsidian Publish has to be, hands-down, my favorite plugin for Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-readwise-official&#34;&gt;Obsidian Readwise Official&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number eight is the Readwise Official plugin and this is a plugin that I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting for a very long time. In fact, before the official plugin came out, I created my own Python script that I was running regularly just to be able to move my things from Readwise to Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt;, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know, is a way to collect all of the things that you&amp;rsquo;re doing on the internet. It&amp;rsquo;s an easy way to collect eBooks, web articles, audiobooks, tweets, and even PDFs. And it all brings your highlights of those into your Obsidian vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a really essential part to my learning process because it ensures that everything I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from a variety of different sources ends up in my Obsidian vault for me to process and analyze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-sync&#34;&gt;Obsidian Sync&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number nine is Obsidian Sync and it is also a premium add-on, kind of like Obsidian Publish, but it&amp;rsquo;s also totally optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t really need Obsidian Sync. I already use Dropbox, but unfortunately, one of the problems with Dropbox is that you can&amp;rsquo;t yet use it to sync between different devices. I use Obsidian on my laptop, on my iPad, and on my Samsung mobile. So I have three different devices that I need all of my notes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently two options for this. It&amp;rsquo;s either iCloud or Obsidian Sync. I don&amp;rsquo;t like iCloud, and so, Obsidian Sync is my service of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-templater&#34;&gt;Obsidian Templater&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number 10 is the most recent plugin of this 10 and it is Templater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now don&amp;rsquo;t get it confused with Templates which is an Obsidian core plugin. TemplateR is a community plugin that&amp;rsquo;s like Templates on steroids. It extends templating functionality by letting you run JavaScript in your vault. This blows the functionality of Obsidian wide open as now I can run JavaScript in my vault to do certain things for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already a fan of the core plugin Templates, so having Templater and all of the customization options that are possible is just amazing. Definitely recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve made it this far and you&amp;rsquo;re wondering what the heck is Obsidian, well maybe take a step back and watch this video on how to get started with Obsidian. And if you want to know about my usage of any of the particular plugins that I mentioned, leave me a comment below so that I know that I should make a video on that next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for watching. Happy note taking!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about how to ignore all the complicated methodologies for note-taking and just get started with the good old-fashioned art of taking notes - with &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, of course!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating a D&amp;D DM&#39;s Brain Attic With Obsidian</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started using &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; for professional reasons. I use it daily as my main task management and personal knowledge management system for my main job as a software developer advocate at &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io&#34;&gt;k6.io&lt;/a&gt;. However, a surprising use case of mine for Obsidian is playing Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, the tabletop roleplaying game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a video of me walking through my setup for how to use Obsidian to create my own &amp;ldquo;DM&amp;rsquo;s Brain Attic&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

      <title>5 Things the Obsidian Templater Plugin Can Do That Templates Can&#39;t</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220131-5-things-the-obsidian-templater-can-do-that-templates-cant/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 22:46:52 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220131-5-things-the-obsidian-templater-can-do-that-templates-cant/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Templater plugin is what the core Templates plugin should have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name is unfortunate, as it implies that the two plugins are similar. Turns out they&amp;rsquo;re only similar in that one is a limited version of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what you can do with Templater&amp;ndash; and not with Templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;add-dynamic-variables-to-your-notes&#34;&gt;Add dynamic variables to your notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking, &lt;em&gt;but Templates can already add dates&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templater can do that, &lt;em&gt;and more&lt;/em&gt;. You can use it to fetch values in YAML frontmatter, random quotes from the interwebs, and even clipboard contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-your-notes-context-sensitive&#34;&gt;Make your notes context-sensitive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templater can create notes with different templates depending on context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you could set up Obsidian to create a new note using the &lt;em&gt;Person&lt;/em&gt; template in the &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt; folder but a &lt;em&gt;Weekly Review&lt;/em&gt; note on Sunday nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;increment-your-notes-automatically&#34;&gt;Increment your notes automatically&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templater can automatically increment new instances of a series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can set it up to create a session log for your 100th D&amp;amp;D session, a review note for your 12th monthly review, or your 10th book review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;interact-with-other-plugins&#34;&gt;Interact with other plugins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templater leverages all the best parts of Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read from and write to YAML frontmatter using Dataview, or run commands that create notes based on text input with Buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;write-and-run-your-own-scripts&#34;&gt;Write and run your own scripts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templater lets you write and call user scripts within an Obsidian note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the ultimate in extensibility. The ability to run custom JavaScript means you&amp;rsquo;re limited only by your imagination (and skill).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;templater-lets-you-turn-obsidian-into-exactly-what-you-want&#34;&gt;Templater lets you turn Obsidian into exactly what you want.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And isn&amp;rsquo;t that what a PKM should do?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>10 Mandatory Obsidian Plugins for Every Software Engineer</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220129-10-mandatory-obsidian-plugins-for-every-software-engineer/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Jan 2022 23:58:12 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220129-10-mandatory-obsidian-plugins-for-every-software-engineer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t installed any Obsidian plugins, you&amp;rsquo;re missing out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other mainstream PKM apps seem to have been built with the intention of hand-holding users through every step using a pretty interface. On the other hand, Obsidian is perfectly suited to power users who want to change the tool to meet their needs exactly. But you can only do that with plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are 10 Obsidian plugins you should install if you work in tech:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enable-these-core-plugins&#34;&gt;Enable these Core Plugins.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core plugins are shipped with Obsidian but are disabled by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily notes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Creates a new Markdown page according to a specified template that serves as a scratchpad and springboard for every new day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Templates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Lets you define predetermined formats that can be inserted into notes. Some template examples: Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Yearly notes, meeting notes with agendas, person notes to create your own CRM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Backlinks&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; When you have a note open, this shows you all the other notes that have referred to it, explicitly (via [[links]]) or implicitly (unlinked).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quick switcher&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Lets you find any note by hitting CMD+O and showing search results as you type. With this enabled, I never bother with folders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workspaces&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Lets you save the exact arrangement of notes and sidebar options you have selected, and then load it quickly later. I have workspaces for writing, processing content, playing D&amp;amp;D, and making videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-these-community-plugins&#34;&gt;Install these Community Plugins.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community plugins are created by users and open-sourced on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Calendar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Adds a real-world calendar to your side panel that shows daily and weekly notes. Use Fantasy Calendar for even more customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor Syntax Highlight&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Formats text in code blocks according to the programming language set. Drastically improves readability of any code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Readwise Official&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Regularly imports your highlights from ebooks, web articles, audiobooks, tweets, and PDFs into your Obsidian vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Templater&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Extends templating functionality by letting you run JAVASCRIPT. In your vault! This blows the functionality of Obsidian wide open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dataview&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Turns your Obsidian vault into a database using custom parameters in YAML frontmatter. There&amp;rsquo;s even a way to write queries in js!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>How to Actually Remember What You Learn, for Engineers with Long Reading Lists</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220124-how-to-actually-remember-what-you-learn/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 21:47:59 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220124-how-to-actually-remember-what-you-learn/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who says you need the terminology of the Zettelkasten process? Here&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;ve learned how to learn and how to apply new ideas to my daily work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, you probably make your living on what you&amp;rsquo;ve learned that other people haven&amp;rsquo;t. Unfortunately, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have a written system to keep track of new ideas, you&amp;rsquo;ll probably unlearn everything in a few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;most-people-think-reading--learning&#34;&gt;Most people think reading = learning.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s why reading isn&amp;rsquo;t enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our brains are best at linking concepts, not at remembering them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing doesn&amp;rsquo;t help us learn; it IS how we learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t learn to swim by reading about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If reading isn&amp;rsquo;t enough, then what should you do instead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-1-consume&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Consume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to consume content, but &lt;em&gt;selectively&lt;/em&gt; so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content could be a book, a video, a podcast, an article, or even a conversation. &lt;em&gt;Take notes&lt;/em&gt; on the author&amp;rsquo;s main points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example:&lt;/em&gt; Shape Up is a methodology emphasising iterative cycles, &amp;ldquo;betting&amp;rdquo; on work to be done, and building fully integrated slices of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-2-redefine&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: Redefine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, go beyond facts and add your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about the broader picture of what the author might be saying, and supplement it with &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; opinions. &lt;em&gt;Example:&lt;/em&gt; Shape Up is an Agile methodology concerned with the limits we should apply to different stages of work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-3-contextualize&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Contextualize&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about what the content means to you, specifically&amp;ndash; how does it stack with other things you&amp;rsquo;ve learned? Where does it fit into your interests? Accept that your context, and your notes, will change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example:&lt;/em&gt; Shape Up&amp;rsquo;s idea of fully integrated work supports the notion of context-switching (see: Continuous integration, Multithreading) but could be in contention with productivity concepts like deep work (David Allen), batching, and Productivity Momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;its-your-brain&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s your brain!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, nobody can tell you the &amp;ldquo;right&amp;rdquo; way to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to use Dataview and Templater to run JavaScript in Obsidian for automating task management</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220116-how-to-use-dataview-and-templater-to-run-javascript-in-obsidian/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 16:30:22 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220116-how-to-use-dataview-and-templater-to-run-javascript-in-obsidian/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TIL how to run JavaScript in @obsdmd. A friend of mine had an interesting use case: He had a long reading list from his studies, and wanted to use Obsidian to decide what he could read given a certain amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/eccc6f910cdc48a5b7934b53a5a0f244&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the script&lt;/a&gt;.
And here&amp;rsquo;s the end result:
&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/templater-demo.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Gif of the full setup working&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requires: Obsidian. The Dataview and Templater plugins. Also requires a separate markdown page for every chapter or bite-sized section of the book or course, with the metadata &lt;code&gt;time_required&lt;/code&gt; in the YAML frontmatter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why Dataview? Dataview can parse that frontmatter, grab the value for &lt;code&gt;time_required&lt;/code&gt;, and return a list of pages and links. There is a Dataview Query Language, but dataviewjs is more extensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why Templater? I initially wanted to write a script within a dataviewjs block, but:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dataview results are only rendered in Preview mode (which I don&amp;rsquo;t spend much time in)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I hate testing JavaScript within Obsidian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I created a folder &lt;code&gt;scripts&lt;/code&gt; within my vault and selected it as the &amp;ldquo;user scripts folder&amp;rdquo; in Templater settings. Then, I created a script, &lt;code&gt;returnStudyOptions.js&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/eccc6f910cdc48a5b7934b53a5a0f244&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the gist for that&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new note, I typed &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;% tp.user.returnStudyOptions(tp, 60) %&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This line calls the script I created and also passes 60 minutes as the time available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I selected &amp;ldquo;Templater: Replace templates in the active file&amp;rdquo; from the Command Pane, which runs the script and replaces the line with the script&amp;rsquo;s returned value, which looks something like this:
&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/templater-result.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of the notes returned by the script&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also assigned a hotkey to for replacing the template, for ease of use. That&amp;rsquo;s it! I thought this was a fun way to learn how to use JavaScript in Obsidian. Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ealameda&#34;&gt;@ealameda&lt;/a&gt; for the use case!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building a DM&#39;s Brain Attic</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220115-building-a-dms-brain-attic/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 16:45:22 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220115-building-a-dms-brain-attic/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Anyone other DMs have this problem? My TRPGs folder, containing paid third-party assets for D&amp;amp;D and other RPGs, is made up of 37,884 items (287 GB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how I make sure I actually get value out of this embarrassment of riches: 👇&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/trpgs.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of my TRPGs folder with all my third-party items&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SlyFlourish&#34;&gt;@SlyFlourish&lt;/a&gt; wrote an article applying Sherlock Holmes&amp;rsquo;s brain attic for lazy dungeon masters, and he called it the &amp;ldquo;[DM Brain Attic](&lt;a href=&#34;https://slyflourish.com/brain_attic.html%22&#34;&gt;https://slyflourish.com/brain_attic.html&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is to collect interesting techniques or ideas and file them away for later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a good idea, but for most of us, this attic is theoretical. We read books, we watch videos, and we read blog posts on monsters and settings and plots, and we trust that they&amp;rsquo;ll all be saved somewhere in our heads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not how it works. Our minds are good at making connections, not remembering CRs from monster statblocks. So how do we make this DM Brain Attic less theoretical and more practical?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read and take notes. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read everything you&amp;rsquo;ve bought, you&amp;rsquo;re buying too much. Read what you&amp;rsquo;ve got and write down the parts that are actually relevant to you and your game. Here&amp;rsquo;s what mine looks like for the first Arcadia (@helloMCDM) issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/arcadia.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of my notes on Arcadia issue 1&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Combine like with like. This is the hard part, because it involves creating a central place for monsters, items, spells, etc. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/xios-guide-to-monsters&#34;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is my attempt to do this for monsters. It creates one page per monster that includes its source. Here&amp;rsquo;s a monster example.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/zombie.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of a monster page&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example for items that includes SRD items and Vault of Magic Items (by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/KoboldPress&#34;&gt;@KoboldPress&lt;/a&gt;). Each one links to a page for the item with full details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/vault-of-magic.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of my page of items&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resurface via search: You may have noticed the metadata in the previous page. The metadata gives me criteria to search monsters by. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I can query my monster database using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview&#34;&gt;Dataview plugin&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/dataview-query.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of a monster query using Dataview&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s the result of that query, returning monsters that fit my criteria and, importantly, which of my PDFs they come from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/dataview-result.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of the results from the Dataview query shown earlier&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resurface via random table generators. Another way that I resurface content is by using random table generators using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller&#34;&gt;Dice Roller plugin&lt;/a&gt; for Obsidian by Jeremy Valentine. Here&amp;rsquo;s my NPC page, compiled from multiple sources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/npc-rolls.png&#34; alt=&#34;My NPC creation page with randomized traits&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each die icon can be clicked to generate a new &amp;ldquo;roll&amp;rdquo;. Here&amp;rsquo;s a gif for how that works, using stuff from Sly Flourish&amp;rsquo;s Uncovered Secrets, accessible to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.patreon.com/slyflourish&#34;&gt;his Patreons&lt;/a&gt;. Each click &amp;ldquo;rolls&amp;rdquo; on a table I&amp;rsquo;ve defined in a separate note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/uncoveredsecrets_02.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Gif of how my random tables created from Sly Flourish&amp;amp;rsquo;s Uncovered Secrets&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is building a DM Brain Attic a lot of work? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how likely is it that I&amp;rsquo;d use my 287 GB of third-party stuff while preparing for my game if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have this system? Not very.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least this way, I&amp;rsquo;m using what I&amp;rsquo;ve actually bought and putting good content into a very real DM&amp;rsquo;s Brain Attic that I can actually scrounge around for good ideas in, before or during a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to know more, check out this video I made about how I use Obsidian to run and play D&amp;amp;D online:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Set Goals in Obsidian for 2022</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220112-how-to-set-goals-in-obsidian-for-2022/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you set goals in Obsidian?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolutions are infamously left undone. So what should you do instead? OKRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting OKRs (Objective Key Results) instead of resolutions increases your chances of succeeding. Tracking your progress throughout the year also make sure you&amp;rsquo;re getting things done. In this video, I talk about what OKRs are and how I&amp;rsquo;ve set them up in Obsidian for the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Obsidian for the Uninitiated</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220110-obsidian-for-the-uninitiated/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 23:07:06 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220110-obsidian-for-the-uninitiated/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;obsidian-for-the-uninitiated&#34;&gt;Obsidian for the Uninitiated&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve installed Obsidian and created a new vault. Now what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it can be more than a little daunting to get started with. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that there are terms like &lt;em&gt;Zettelkasten&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Maps of Content&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;fleeting notes&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;digital garden&lt;/em&gt; that are all just trying to structure what we all learned to do in primary school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;start-by-logging-what-youre-doing&#34;&gt;Start by logging what you&amp;rsquo;re doing.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a rigid structure does wonders for curtailing creativity and plain fun. Instead, I recommend starting small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some small steps to take after installing Obsidian:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-1-enable-the-daily-notes-plugin&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1: Enable the Daily Notes plugin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most game-changing feature of Obsidian is plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go into Settings &amp;gt; Core Plugins, and enable the &lt;em&gt;Daily notes&lt;/em&gt; plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, exit out of the dialog boxes and hit CMD P (Mac) or CTRL P (Windows) to bring up the command pane. Search for and select &lt;em&gt;Daily notes: Open today&amp;rsquo;s daily note&lt;/em&gt;. That creates a new note in your vault with today&amp;rsquo;s date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on, do this every day and log things you do during the day: things to do, appointments to keep, videos you watched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-2-the-next-time-you-consume-content-take-notes&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2: The next time you consume content, take notes.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the next time you read or watch something interesting, type its title into Obsidian with brackets:&lt;code&gt;[[Cool video I watched]]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s now a link. CMD+click on that link, or click the glasses icon on the top right to switch to Preview mode, and then click on the link. You should now have a new note. Write about what you thought of the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-3-start-identifying-and-fleshing-out-ideas&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3: Start identifying and fleshing out ideas.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep going with these steps and every now and then, start to identify cool ideas you come across. Create new notes from them just like you did in Step 2. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about getting it all; just do it when and until you feel like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These three simple steps, over time, will be the foundations of your own Personal Knowlege Management system with Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Ways to Use Obsidian as a Software Engineer</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220109-5-ways-to-use-obsidian-as-a-software-engineer/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 19:20:49 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220109-5-ways-to-use-obsidian-as-a-software-engineer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I wrote about why I think taking notes is the surprising foundation of a tester&amp;rsquo;s career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s not just testers. Every software engineer is a knowledge worker, and that means we get paid for what we know. Using a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://Obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian.md&lt;/a&gt; helps us keep up with the constant barrage of new ideas in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are 5 things I use Obsidian for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-my-very-own-stack-overflow&#34;&gt;#1: My very own Stack Overflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you code, you&amp;rsquo;ve used Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you had your &lt;strong&gt;own&lt;/strong&gt; Stack Overflow, one that contained cheat sheets of every language you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried to hack something up in, including only commands relevant to your job? This is exactly &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Python&#34;&gt;what I&amp;rsquo;ve done for Python&lt;/a&gt; recently, and it&amp;rsquo;s helping me solidify my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-tools-database&#34;&gt;#2: Tools database&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a tool for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep them straight, I have a page for every load testing tool I try, with tutorials for how to get started, an assessment of its features, and observations I had while attempting to learn it. &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/k6+(tool)&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I have for the load testing tool k6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus: I also use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview&#34;&gt;the Dataview plugin&lt;/a&gt; to query tools that fit my criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-an-agile-workspace&#34;&gt;#3: An Agile workspace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Agile is good enough for my professional work, it&amp;rsquo;s good enough for my personal work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban&#34;&gt;Kanban plugin&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of projects, create weekly and monthly review/retro templates, and work iteratively using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bjsi/incremental-writing&#34;&gt;the Incremental Writing plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-a-public-learning-log&#34;&gt;#4: A public learning log&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning in public is the fastest way to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m trying to figure something out, I document my attempts. With Obsidian Publish, I can quickly push this log out to my domain and share them with colleagues to get a quick review so that they can easily follow my train of thought and tell me where I went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-a-digital-garden-of-software-ideas&#34;&gt;#5: A digital garden of software ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build libraries, not feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Obsidian to save things I read/watch/listen to but also to save space for ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to germinate. I publish notes before they&amp;rsquo;re fully fleshed out, with the goal of growing everything over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com&#34;&gt;Today, I have 4,567 notes&lt;/a&gt;, all about things that matter to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every engineer should have a PKM system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Creating a Content Calendar in Obsidian</title>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that I&amp;rsquo;ve long given up using &lt;a href=&#34;https://notion.so&#34;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt; as my main note-taking tool, I&amp;rsquo;ve still continued to use it as a content calendar. &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; just hadn&amp;rsquo;t caught up with it in terms of functionality&amp;hellip; until now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, I show my current Obsidian workflow for creating and maintaining a content calendar.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a presentation I participated in about a bunch of nerds who like both &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; and D&amp;amp;D. My part begins around &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovqu_1aW3Sw&amp;amp;t=2720&#34;&gt;0:45:20&lt;/a&gt;, but I thought the other speakers&amp;rsquo; parts were really fascinating as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;meta property=&#34;og:image:width&#34; content=&#34;1200&#34; /&gt;
&lt;meta property=&#34;og:image:height&#34; content=&#34;630&#34; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/non-lazy-dms.PNG&#34; alt=&#34;Graph view in Obsidian of my three D&amp;amp;D campaigns&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, I wrote about how I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210809-dnd-obsidian-player/&#34;&gt;D&amp;amp;D as a player&lt;/a&gt; in a 4e campaign (I play a half-elf hybrid wizard/cleric). This is about my second weekly game, in which I am the Dungeon Master for a 5e campaign. I&amp;rsquo;m a relatively new DM (I&amp;rsquo;ve got &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Exandria/World&#34;&gt;39 games&lt;/a&gt; under my belt at the time this writing, and Obsidian is at the center of my workflow for improving my DMing skills, getting inspiration, preparing for a game, running the game, and making sure my players are having fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, my setup is the Non-Lazy DM&amp;rsquo;s approach to preparing for D&amp;amp;D games: high-effort, high-touch, and high-return. But I only do it because I enjoy it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;plugins-i-use&#34;&gt;Plugins I use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is going to be a long article, so if you&amp;rsquo;re just after the plugins I use, here they are up front!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I go into detail for some, but not all of these, in the article below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jeremy Valentine&amp;rsquo;s stuff

&lt;h2 id=&#34;outside-the-game&#34;&gt;Outside the game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I use Obsidian &lt;em&gt;while&lt;/em&gt; playing D&amp;amp;D, I use it most for D&amp;amp;D between games: fleshing out the world, getting inspiration for new adventures, or preparing for specific sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;world-building&#34;&gt;World-building&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many DMs run published campaigns, but I&amp;rsquo;m not one of them. I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s anything wrong with running published campaigns; I just personally enjoy world-building and being able to tailor the environment to what I know my specific players will like. However, I still do read campaign books, for D&amp;amp;D as well as for other systems, for inspiration. I am also a voracious fantasy reader, and consider everything fair game for &amp;ldquo;stealing&amp;rdquo; for my games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve begun experimenting with is processing my fiction reads the way I do my nonfiction reads. What better place to look for inspiration about creating a fantasy world than other fantasy worlds? How could I use a &lt;em&gt;Bene Gesserit&lt;/em&gt;-like faction in my campaign?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently reread the first &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; book in preparation for the movie coming out later this year, but while I was reading it, I remembered how much I love the world it&amp;rsquo;s set in. I read books on Kindle, either on my actual physical Kindle ereader or on the Kindle app on my mobile, and I took highlights while I was reading &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;. You can see my full highlights &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Readwise/Books/Dune&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, synced &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210810-readwise-to-obsidian-redux/&#34;&gt;via Readwise&lt;/a&gt;. I highlight turns of phrases I like, character descriptions that sounded cool, or passages that are particularly revealing of the type of world the story of Dune is set in. Below is an example of a quote I highlighted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schools were started to train human talents.” “Bene Gesserit schools?” She nodded. “We have two chief survivors of those ancient schools: the Bene Gesserit and the Spacing Guild. The Guild, so we think, emphasizes almost pure mathematics. Bene Gesserit performs another function.” “Politics,” he said. (&lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&amp;amp;asin=B001F0WXY0&amp;amp;location=248&#34;&gt;Location 248&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really resonated with me as a good characterization of two important factions in the Dune universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, just as I do with nonfiction books, I create a separate note about the book itself, attempting to summarize the parts of it that might be interesting or useful to me in the future. Below is a screenshot of my page on the first book of Dune. I identify &amp;ldquo;Key truths&amp;rdquo; about the world, because I also like to use that terminology when creating secrets or themes for a fantasy world or city I&amp;rsquo;ve created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/dune-processed.png&#34; alt=&#34;My notes on the book Dune&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Book/Dune&#34;&gt;Here are my full notes on Dune&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I also think about tropes or patterns of character, plot, or setting present in the book. I&amp;rsquo;ve started collecting these in a a page called &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Forms&#34;&gt;Forms&lt;/a&gt; in my vault. I think it&amp;rsquo;s useful to spot things that occur again and again in fantasy fiction, whether they&amp;rsquo;re overused or not. If they&amp;rsquo;re tropes that I&amp;rsquo;d rather not repeat, having a &amp;ldquo;formula&amp;rdquo; of the trope helps me either avoid it or consciously subvert it in my games. Sometimes, I just take a form wholesale and incorporate it as is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Form/Nuns+who+think+and+fight&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of a page&lt;/a&gt; I created that was inspired by the Bene Gesserit&amp;ndash; a short note about &amp;ldquo;Nuns who think and fight&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t been doing it for very long, but it&amp;rsquo;s already come in useful when thinking of major events and players in my world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;adventure-creation&#34;&gt;Adventure creation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adventures are smaller-scale and higher-resolution than campaigns or worlds, so I often need more specific notes than forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read and highlight adventure blog posts and articles using &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.readwise.io/readwise-reading-app/&#34;&gt;Readwise&amp;rsquo;s recently announced Reader app&lt;/a&gt;, and then they, along with tweets, books, and PDFs, get sent to Readwise and then Obsidian using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.readwise.io/article/125-how-does-the-readwise-to-obsidian-export-integration-work&#34;&gt;Official Readwise plugin for Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210810-readwise-to-obsidian-redux/&#34;&gt;written about this process in depth&lt;/a&gt;, but here&amp;rsquo;s what that looks like for Mike Shea&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master&lt;/em&gt; - &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/2X93rvX&#34;&gt;affiliate link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/return_of_the_lazy_dm.png&#34; alt=&#34;My notes on Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An advantage of using Reader (which is currently in a private beta, so I&amp;rsquo;m not allowed to share screenshots of it) is that I can even highlight text locked behind a paywall. For example, I have a D&amp;amp;D Beyond subscription and I&amp;rsquo;ve bought all the books available on their store, but most reading apps don&amp;rsquo;t know that, so it&amp;rsquo;s been hard to find one that will let me highlight text from one of the WotC sourcebooks. Not so with Reader. Here&amp;rsquo;s what my highlights from the first chapter of &lt;em&gt;Volo&amp;rsquo;s Guide to Monsters&lt;/em&gt; looks like in my Obsidian vault after it&amp;rsquo;s synced from Reader:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/volos_guide-chapter1.png&#34; alt=&#34;My highlights from Volo&amp;amp;rsquo;s Guide to Monsters&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readwise is great because I can highlight something on my Kindle and worry about processing it later in Obsidian. I process incoming Obsidian notes daily from 9-10pm&amp;ndash; that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I get through them all, just that I have a scheduled time to go through highlights and notes every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For D&amp;amp;D-specific notes, that also involves summarizing what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned into the notes I already have on how to be a dungeon master:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/dm_session_prep.png&#34; alt=&#34;My notes on session prep as a DM&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The referencing feature on Obsidian lets me confidently paraphrase without stealing. All I need to do is put a &lt;code&gt;[^lazydm]&lt;/code&gt; where I want the superscript to be within the text, and then at the end of the note, I put something like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;[^lazydm]: Shea, M. (2018). _Return of the lazy dungeon master_. [[Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master|My highlights]].&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That gets parsed as a footnote by Obsidian and lets me properly credit authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I find good tools that help me flesh out adventures, I try to update &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Exandria/DM+Tools+and+Inspiration&#34;&gt;my page on DM tools and inspiration&lt;/a&gt;, so they&amp;rsquo;re all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While creating adventures, I like to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-admonition&#34;&gt;Obsidian Admonition&lt;/a&gt; to call out specific parts of the text for me as I&amp;rsquo;m running the adventure, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-admonition-example.png&#34; alt=&#34;Sample of how I use Obsidian Admonition&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;random-tables&#34;&gt;Random tables&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely have overarching plans about the wider plot in the world at large, but I also like to be surprised. Throwing random elements into games is one of the ways that I can keep myself on my toes and remind myself that I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one making the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many random tables in both official and unofficial D&amp;amp;D sourcebooks, but I only use those as starting points. For me, creating random tables that are tailored to my characters and to the things they care about is where it&amp;rsquo;s at!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve experimented with &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/dndgen/characters.html&#34;&gt;creating my own random generators&lt;/a&gt; for various things, as well as using existing ones like &lt;a href=&#34;https://donjon.bin.sh/&#34;&gt;Donjon&lt;/a&gt;, but it&amp;rsquo;s an Obsidian plugin, Jeremy Valentine&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller&#34;&gt;Dice Roller&lt;/a&gt;, that I have settled on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name &amp;ldquo;Dice Roller&amp;rdquo; makes you think it&amp;rsquo;s only for rolling dice, but it&amp;rsquo;s much more than that. Its REAL value, in my opinion, is in how it lets me create tables for ANYTHING, and then randomly pull one row out of it. Here&amp;rsquo;s how it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you create a table. I had a session where my players discovered a place I called &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Exandria/Shipwreck+Beach&#34;&gt;Shipwreck Beach&lt;/a&gt;, and had a lot of fun going through several of the ships that were there. Here&amp;rsquo;s a table of &amp;ldquo;encounters&amp;rdquo; I put together for that session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;### Ship encounters

| Roll | Encounter                                                             |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Carnivorous Ship, ToB II p. 56                                        |
| 2    | Map Mimic: https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/1624929-map-mimic       |
| 3    | Random curse: p.249 of GM&amp;#39;s Book of Random Encounters - d100          |
| 4    | Clockwork weaving spider (1, ToB p. 66)                               |
| 5    | 1d6 Cobbleswarm (2, ToB p. 68)                                        |
| 6    | a feral little girl wearing a periapt of proof against poison         |
| 7    | A large gold coin bearing the crest of the Kryn Dynasty and the queen |
| 8    | Book about the Arms of the Betrayer Gods                              |
^ship
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note the &lt;code&gt;^ship&lt;/code&gt; identifier at the bottom there&amp;ndash; it can be called whatever you want, but you&amp;rsquo;ll use that identifier when rolling on that table. I also included the &lt;code&gt;Roll&lt;/code&gt; column, in case I decided on the spot to let players roll instead of doing it myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, in another note (or the same one, if you want), include this line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Shipwreck encounter: `dice: [[Shipwreck Beach#^ship]]`
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you flip to Preview mode, you&amp;rsquo;ll see this in the place of the line above:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/shipwreck_encounter-example.png&#34; alt=&#34;Random Shipwreck encounter using Obsidian Dice Roller&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it!! This has made a HUGE impact on my games, because it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to create or modify tables. I use random encounter tables sparingly &lt;em&gt;during&lt;/em&gt; the game, but often use it &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; a game, to introduce something fresh that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;session-prep&#34;&gt;Session prep&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you might have guessed, I mostly use Sly Flourish&amp;rsquo;s Lazy DM steps for encounter creation, saved as an Obsidian template:&lt;/p&gt;

## Log
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before each session, I&amp;rsquo;ll go through each of these sections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I add &lt;em&gt;metadata&lt;/em&gt; to every session for use with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview&#34;&gt;Dataview&lt;/a&gt; plugin later, in case I want to do a search for all sessions that involved a particular NPC or that took place in a certain location, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fill out the &lt;em&gt;Session Summary&lt;/em&gt; section &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the game, but I put it at the top so I can immediately see what happened in the session in case I need to refresh my memory on it in the future. I also identify this section with a &lt;code&gt;^summary&lt;/code&gt; so that I can embed it in the next session, as a recap - more on that below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Housekeeping&lt;/em&gt; section, I write down things I want to mention before we dive into the narrative of the session. Usually, these topics are scheduling- or rules-related. For example, if my players have just levelled up and I see that one of them has chosen a feat, I might make a note of it here to make sure that they know what it means. My players are pretty new, so I think it&amp;rsquo;s better to err on the side of more communication rather than less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;Recap&lt;/em&gt; section, I call the sumary from the previous session and embed it into the current session using something like &lt;code&gt;![[38_8360310-8360311 Seduction at the Moonlight Chateau#^summary]]&lt;/code&gt;. When in preview mode, Obsidian shows just that section labelled with &lt;code&gt;^summary&lt;/code&gt; from the previous game. I like to start the game by either reading out the summary myself, or asking one of the players to recount what they remember. That way we&amp;rsquo;re all on the same page when we begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Strong start&lt;/em&gt;, I write a paragraph or two of prepared text that I use to kick off the story. This is usually the only text I&amp;rsquo;ll read out word for word during the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scenes&lt;/em&gt; are a list of events that I THINK will happen. My players frequently surprise me, which I welcome, so I also list these with checkboxes so that I can keep track of where the story deviated from the plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sly Flourish does recommend a separate section for Fantastic Locations, but I tend to prepare these as separate pages. For example, here are my notes on a possible location, &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Exandria/The+Charred+Circus&#34;&gt;The Charred Circus&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t include them within the session note itself, but I do make sure I have a few that characters could go to. Then, I link to all of them from the note I have for the city they&amp;rsquo;re in, &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Exandria/Port+Damali#Geography+and+Map&#34;&gt;like this one for Port Damali&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Secrets and Clues&lt;/em&gt; is where I put a list of 10 things that players MIGHT find out somehow. This is where I look when a player rolls a natural 20 on a Perception check. The idea is to describe &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; the secrets are, but not get too caught up in trying to plan &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the players will find out those secrets. I try to include things that might be interesting for the players, as well as a few potential adventure hooks. &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Exandria/38_8360310-8360311+Seduction+at+the+Moonlight+Chateau#Secrets+and+Clues&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a list that I made for a previous game&lt;/a&gt;. I have never used all 10 up in one game, but I like having more than I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Loot&lt;/em&gt;, I put in any items I know the party will likely get to. If they&amp;rsquo;re in a boss fight, I usually save in this section all the things I&amp;rsquo;ve decided beforehand they&amp;rsquo;ll get. If I don&amp;rsquo;t have something specific like that in mind, I sometimes randomize a bunch of non-magical trinkets. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Exandria/Loot&#34;&gt;Loot page&lt;/a&gt; contains items I&amp;rsquo;ve picked out for specific characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;post-session-processing&#34;&gt;Post-session processing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your players are anything like mine, you&amp;rsquo;ll often find yourself with a bunch of unused material and a lot of stuff you still had to improvise on the spot, despite adequate preparation. That&amp;rsquo;s okay! I actually enjoy when my players do something unexpected. I encourage and reward creative play&amp;hellip; but it does mean that I have to do a bit of a debrief after each session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try not to prepare things that may really be &amp;ldquo;wasted&amp;rdquo;. Things like locations, NPCs, or general plot hooks can usually be recycled. After games, I spend some time tying off loose ends, noting down decisions the party made and the reasoning behind those decisions, and tweaking connections between NPCs or places based on how the party reacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fleshing out bits of the world, with each city or NPC getting a page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tagging cities and NPCs with Location or NPC, and then within the city, doing a query for NPC and &lt;code&gt;city name&lt;/code&gt; to get everyone living in that city.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use metadata for every page in my campaign so that I can use the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview/&#34;&gt;Dataview plugin&lt;/a&gt; later to find whatever I want. You already saw my session template, but here&amp;rsquo;s an NPC template that I use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;---
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;NPC&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;faction&lt;/span&gt;: []
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;: []
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;Exandria&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;campaign&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;The Slayers Five&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;date&lt;/span&gt;: [{{&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;date}}]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;description&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;race&lt;/span&gt;: []
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;gender&lt;/span&gt;: []
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt;: []
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;---
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I insert this template for every single NPC in my world, whether my players get to it or not. Because I use it so often, I&amp;rsquo;ve set up a hotkey for inserting templates in the Obsidian settings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-inserting_template.png&#34; alt=&#34;Setting a hotkey for template insertion&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That way, all I have to do is hit &lt;code&gt;CMD + ;&lt;/code&gt; and select the right template from the list, and the text above is inserted at the beginning of the note as frontmatter, with all the fields I need to fill out. The date is also automatically generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the Dataview plugin, I can then embed queries on location pages so that I can see NPCs in that place at a glance. For example, here&amp;rsquo;s the snippet I put under the &lt;code&gt;People&lt;/code&gt; section in my Port Damali page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34; data-lang=&#34;sql&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010&#34;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;dataview
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;table&lt;/span&gt; shop &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; Shop, faction &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; Faction, description &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; Description &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Exandria&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;WHERE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;contains&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;NPC&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;contains&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;location&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;Port Damali&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;SORT file.name &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;ASC&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010&#34;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;```&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;(If you try this, remove the backticks &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; in the snippet above&amp;ndash; those are just to show you the syntax for a dataview query.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That query, when rendered in Preview mode in Obsidian, looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-dataview-port_damali.png&#34; alt=&#34;Rendered Dataview query in Obsidian Preview mode&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the metadata for every NPC, monster, item, and place in my world is essential for creating queries like this. I&amp;rsquo;ve also found it useful to maintain a model of the metadata I use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;- `type`
	- `NPC`
	- `PC`
	- `shop`
	- `place`
	- `item`
	- `session` for D&amp;amp;D play sessions
	- `quest`
	- `race`
	- `faction`
	- `family`
	- `monster`
	- `condition`
	- `deity`
	- `other` for anything else
- `characters` (for sessions): characters involved in this session
- `deceased`
	- `true`
	- `false`
- `family`
- `faction`
- `race`
- `gender`
- `class`
- `description`
- `date`
- `game_date`
- `world`
	- `Exandria`
	- `Forgotten Realms`
	- `Exandya`
- `campaign`
	- `Order of the Wandering Mind`
	- `The Slayers Five`
	- `Die vergessene Schwester`
	- `Temporary White Circle`
- `shop` (for proprietors)
- `shop_type` (for shops)
	- `general` : general goods store
	- `alchemy`: potions
	- `magical items`: sells magical items
	- `services`: magical spells, messaging, brothel
	- `tavern`: food and drink
	- `inn`: lodging
	- `herbalism`
	- `smithy`
- `location`: city of residence
- `origin`: city of origin
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;during-the-game&#34;&gt;During the game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep a &amp;ldquo;World&amp;rdquo; page for each of my D&amp;amp;D campaigns, including a list of sessions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/campaign-page.png&#34; alt=&#34;Campaign Page with list of sessions&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the game, I use the session page that I mentioned above, and start filling in the &lt;em&gt;Log&lt;/em&gt; section. I tend to take way fewer notes as a DM than as a player, just because I&amp;rsquo;m busy doing other things, but I do always write down things that the players do that I might need to remember later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that comes up frequently in my games is the need to improvise encounters, NPCs, or locations. I&amp;rsquo;ve had great success in creating a &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Exandria/Random+Rolls&#34;&gt;Random Rolls&lt;/a&gt; page that collates many of these random tables in one note. If you click on that link, you unfortunately won&amp;rsquo;t be able to see the results rendered, because the Dice Roller plugin isn&amp;rsquo;t available for Obsidian Publish, but maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll get an idea of things I&amp;rsquo;m rolling on. Most of the tables referred to are from &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Exandria/Random+Tables&#34;&gt;this Random Tables note&lt;/a&gt;, but every now and then I&amp;rsquo;ll include tables in location notes instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always have this Random Rolls page up as part of my DM workspace, in case I need to quickly improvise something. Here&amp;rsquo;s what the NPC section looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/npc_dice_roller-example.png&#34; alt=&#34;Random rolls on the NPC random tables&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can use any or all of those things that I want, or use them as inspiration for something else I make up on the spot. Either way, it means I&amp;rsquo;ll never be completely at a loss for the name of an NPC. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;initiative-tracker&#34;&gt;Initiative Tracker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use D&amp;amp;D Beyond for character sheets, but I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-initiative-tracker&#34;&gt;Jeremy Valentine&amp;rsquo;s initiative tracker&lt;/a&gt; to handle combat because there are a few critical features that D&amp;amp;D Beyond&amp;rsquo;s Encounter Tracker doesn&amp;rsquo;t yet support:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Status conditions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Easy to tweak) homebrew monsters&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hiding monsters&amp;rsquo; names from the players&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Initiative Tracker plugin supports all of these. When activated, it appears as a side panel in Obsidian:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/initiative_tracker_plugin.png&#34; alt=&#34;Jeremy Valentine&amp;amp;rsquo;s initiative tracker for Obsidian&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can easily see everyone&amp;rsquo;s HP and AC at a glance, and also apply special status conditions when necessary. My players don&amp;rsquo;t have to know whose turn it is&amp;ndash; they just have to know when their turn is. I warn them verbally when they&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;on deck&amp;rdquo;, and they haven&amp;rsquo;t had an issue with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D&amp;amp;D Beyond does allow you to create homebrew monsters, but the only real benefit to doing so is to be able to use it in their Combat Tracker, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been using another plugin by Jeremy Valentine, the author of this one, to create monster statblocks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;statblocks&#34;&gt;Statblocks&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-5e-statblocks&#34;&gt;The 5e statblocks plugin&lt;/a&gt; lets me easily create homebrew creatures just by using this format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;\```statblock
name: string
size: string
type: string
subtype: string
alignment: string
ac: number
hp: number
hit_dice: string
speed: string
stats: [number, number, number, number, number, number]
fage_stats: [number, number, number, number, number, number, number, number, number]
saves:
    - &amp;lt;ability-score&amp;gt;: number
skillsaves:
    - &amp;lt;skill-name&amp;gt;: number
damage_vulnerabilities: string
damage_resistances: string
damage_immunities: string
condition_immunities: string
senses: string
languages: string
cr: number
spells:
    - &amp;lt;description&amp;gt;
    - &amp;lt;spell level&amp;gt;: &amp;lt;spell-list&amp;gt;
traits:
    - [&amp;lt;trait-name&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;trait-description&amp;gt;]
    - ...
actions:
    - [&amp;lt;trait-name&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;trait-description&amp;gt;]
    - ...
legendary_actions:
    - [&amp;lt;legendary_actions-name&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;legendary_actions-description&amp;gt;]
    - ...
reactions:
    - [&amp;lt;reaction-name&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;reaction-description&amp;gt;]
    - ...
\```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Again, remove the backticks &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; at the starting and ending lines of the snippet above if you copy and paste this into your vault.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually start with a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; monster from official or unofficial sourcebooks, then tweak it from there. For example, here&amp;rsquo;s a sample one that I tweaked from &lt;a href=&#34;https://koboldpress.com/tome-of-beasts/&#34;&gt;Tome of Beasts&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-statblocks-example.png&#34; alt=&#34;Sample of 5e statblock plugin in action&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part about this plugin is that it integrates with the Initiative Tracker. When you create a statblock and save it, that monster then becomes available for use within the Initiative Tracker, as you can see from the screenshot above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;publishing&#34;&gt;Publishing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I subscribe to &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Exandria/World&#34;&gt;Obsidian Publish&lt;/a&gt;, partly to give back to the fine Obsidian developers who&amp;rsquo;ve made a tool I use daily and partly because I&amp;rsquo;ve found that it&amp;rsquo;s reduced friction in publishing. I use it primarily for non-D&amp;amp;D-related things, but D&amp;amp;D is part of my life, so it&amp;rsquo;s there as well. &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Exandria/World&#34;&gt;You can find my notes on the D&amp;amp;D campaign I DM here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the plugins that I use unfortunately don&amp;rsquo;t render correctly when Published, but the developers are working on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I publish my campaign notes mainly because I love seeing other DM&amp;rsquo;s thought processes and systems, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d return the favour by sharing mine as well. In case you were wondering, my players don&amp;rsquo;t know I publish these notes&amp;ndash; or, at least, I hope they don&amp;rsquo;t!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;player-facing-campaign-vault&#34;&gt;Player-facing campaign vault&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to drop handouts into a WhatsApp group with my players, but it became increasingly unwieldy to look for something. We switched to Slack, but that had the same problem of needing to scroll back through lots of photos before finding the right one. Photos aren&amp;rsquo;t very searchable in those apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I switched to Obsidian for handouts. I created a separate vault for the campaign and shared it with my players via Dropbox. I did have to talk them through the setup, but it&amp;rsquo;s worked out very well for us as a free alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the vault, I put things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pictures and other handouts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Session videos and summaries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Links for everything we use as a group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;House rules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;session-page&#34;&gt;Session page&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I create a page for every session we have, which has a section for the video recording of that session (unlisted and just for us, sorry), a player-friendly summary, and a log. The log is where I dump photos I give them during the session. Here&amp;rsquo;s what that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-player-vault-session.png&#34; alt=&#34;Session page for my player-facing vault&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t put any other notes in the log; that&amp;rsquo;s the players&amp;rsquo; jobs (if they want to).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to have a &amp;ldquo;Story Thus Far&amp;rdquo; page that embeds the video and summary sections of all the sessions, so any of us can read through it to remember what&amp;rsquo;s happened. It&amp;rsquo;s fun to see how far we&amp;rsquo;ve come as a group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-player_vault-story-thus-far.png&#34; alt=&#34;Story Thus Far page in my player-facing vault&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;about-our-game&#34;&gt;About our game&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The About our game page has a list of links to all the tools we use, our schedule, and a few things about the campaign and the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-player_vault-about_our_game.png&#34; alt=&#34;About our game page in my player-facing vault&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rules&#34;&gt;Rules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep a house rules page that shows all the extra rules I&amp;rsquo;ve put into the game. I mostly play with all the WoTC-produced sourcebooks, but I&amp;rsquo;ve added some extra rules about things that my players are interested in, such as strongholds (for which I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/collections/strongholds-followers-books&#34;&gt;Matt Colville&amp;rsquo;s Strongholds &amp;amp; Followers book&lt;/a&gt;) and smith&amp;rsquo;s tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-player_vault-rules.png&#34; alt=&#34;Rules page in my player-facing vault&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have some other pages on rules that come up often, such as Ship statblocks (since the campaign is set on a coast) and suggested downtime activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I call my approach to game preparation the Non-Lazy DM&amp;rsquo;s approach as a tongue-in-cheek nod to &lt;a href=&#34;https://slyflourish.com&#34;&gt;Mike Shea&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; content, but there&amp;rsquo;s truth to the moniker, too. My setup is extremely detail-oriented, time-consuming, and &lt;em&gt;fun&lt;/em&gt;&amp;hellip; at least for me! And that&amp;rsquo;s the key: I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be doing any of this if I didn&amp;rsquo;t find it truly enjoyable to world-build to this level of detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a non-lazy DM too, thanks for sticking around! I hope this has given you some ideas for how you could use Obsidian to run your games and stimulate your imagination, too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to import Shortform highlights to Obsidian via Readwise</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210815-shortform-to-readwise/</link>

      <description>

&lt;meta property=“og:image” content=&#34;/assets/20210816-shortform-to-readwise-title.png.png&#34; /&gt;
&lt;meta property=”og:image:width” content=”1200″ /&gt;
&lt;meta property=”og:image:height” content=”628″ /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20210816-shortform-to-readwise-title.png&#34; alt=&#34;Shortform to Readwise hero photo&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always been dubious of those book summary apps. You know the ones&amp;ndash; they tend to have obnoxious ads that promise to help you &amp;ldquo;read 5 books a day&amp;rdquo; or learn the world&amp;rsquo;s secrets in 15 minutes. Having tried a few of them, I&amp;rsquo;ve been disappointed with the quality of their summaries (or lack thereof). They attempt to distill the message of a 300+ page book into a handful of bullet points, which I&amp;rsquo;ve found neither accurate nor useful. Recently, though, I found myself happily subscribing to one, and here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-shortform-and-why-is-it-awesome&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s Shortform and why is it awesome?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://shortform.com/nicole&#34;&gt;Shortform&lt;/a&gt; really took me aback because it isn&amp;rsquo;t just a book summary. I should mention here that I&amp;rsquo;m not affiliated with Shortform and gain nothing by recommending them. I&amp;rsquo;m just a happy subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I read their guide for the book &lt;em&gt;Why We Sleep&lt;/em&gt;, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Shortform not only summarized it succinctly, but they also added intelligent counterarguments to the author&amp;rsquo;s points. In some cases, when the author made a false claim, there were Shortform notes that linked to studies that showed &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; the claim was false. In other cases, Shortform mentioned related concepts proposed in other books that strengthened the author&amp;rsquo;s viewpoint. I found myself looking up their guides of books I&amp;rsquo;d already read, just because I was curious to see if I had missed anything. And I had!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, Shortform is the only book summary reader I&amp;rsquo;ve found that goes beyond summarizing and actually &lt;em&gt;adds value&lt;/em&gt; to the reading experience, &lt;em&gt;even if you&amp;rsquo;ve read the book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also have a one-page summary of the book AND a summary per chapter, so information is presented at different levels of detail. In my time with it, my most frequent workflow with it has involved reading the one-page summary of a book, buying it if it was interestering enough, reading the book, and then going back to Shortform to go read the chapter summaries. And both the one-page and detailed chapter summaries, including Shortform notes, can be highlighted!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally I wanted to take it further than that. I already &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210810-readwise-to-obsidian-redux&#34;&gt;sync my Kindle highlights to Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; automatically and incrementally process them in Obsidian, so I wrote a script to have my Shortform highlights going to &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20210816-shortform-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Shortform highlights in my Obsidian vault&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Shortform highlights for the book Mindset, in my Obsidian vault.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screenshot above shows the final result: highlights I made in the Shortform web or mobile app that have been synced to a page in my Obsidian vault. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I did that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Since this article was published, Shortform and Readwise have created an integration, so the script I mention here is no longer necessary. Click &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20221021-obsidian-for-non-coders&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see what I&amp;rsquo;d recommend doing today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-you-need&#34;&gt;What you need&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://shortform.com/nicole&#34;&gt;Shortform&lt;/a&gt; account. &lt;em&gt;(affiliate link)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/nicole&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt; account. &lt;em&gt;(This is an affiliate link. If you sign up with this link, you&amp;rsquo;ll get a two-month free trial instead of one, and I get a small percentage if you sign up for a plan.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tool that Readwise can export to, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://roamresearch.com&#34;&gt;Roam Research&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://notion.so&#34;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://evernote.com&#34;&gt;Evernote&lt;/a&gt;. You can also use their CSV and Markdown exports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A local installation of Python 3, which you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.python.org/downloads/&#34;&gt;download here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian is my Personal Knowledge Management tool of choice, and I use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210810-readwise-to-obsidian-redux/&#34;&gt;Readwise Official community plugin&lt;/a&gt; to get Readwise to send highlights to Obsidian. However, using Obsidian is not necessary as my script connects only Shortform to Readwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-setup&#34;&gt;The setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clone &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/shortform-to-readwise&#34;&gt;my Shortform-to-Readwise repository on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; or download it to your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;enter-your-tokens&#34;&gt;Enter your tokens&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file &lt;code&gt;variables.py&lt;/code&gt; requires two tokens: one from your Shortform account and another from your Readwise account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# Your authorization token for Shortform&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;authToken &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# Your Readwise API token&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# Retrieve this token from https://readwise.io/access_token&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;readwiseToken &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;getting-your-shortform-token&#34;&gt;Getting your Shortform token&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a little hacky, because Shortform doesn&amp;rsquo;t expose an API token in their web app. So you&amp;rsquo;ll need to log in to your Shortform account and open up DevTools in your browser. In Chrome, go to Options &amp;gt; More Tools &amp;gt; Developer Tools (or, on Mac, hit CMD+OPTION+I). Click on the Network panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should now see Shortform on one side, and DevTools on another in the same browser window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.shortform.com/app/highlights&#34;&gt;your Highlights page&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so will populate the Network panel with a bunch of requests that look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20210816-shortform-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;DevTools open in Chrome, showing requests from Shortform&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;DevTools open in Chrome, showing requests from Shortform.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the request with the name &lt;code&gt;?sort=date&lt;/code&gt;, highlighted above. That&amp;rsquo;ll open another side panel that will show Headers. Scroll down to the section marked &amp;ldquo;Request Headers&amp;rdquo;, and look for where it says &lt;code&gt;Authorization: Basic &lt;/code&gt; followed by a bunch of characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20210816-shortform-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Authorization headers for Shortform, in DevTools&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Authorization headers for Shortform, in DevTools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve removed my personal authorization token from the screenshot above, but it&amp;rsquo;s a long series of characters that comes after &lt;code&gt;Authorization: Basic &lt;/code&gt;. Go ahead and right click on it and click Copy Value. Paste it into &lt;code&gt;variables.py&lt;/code&gt; as the value for &lt;code&gt;authToken&lt;/code&gt;, and then _remove &lt;code&gt;Basic &lt;/code&gt; (including the space after it) so that you&amp;rsquo;re saving only everything that comes afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;getting-your-readwise-token&#34;&gt;Getting your Readwise token&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, this one&amp;rsquo;s a little easier. Go to &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/access_token&#34;&gt;this page on Readwise&lt;/a&gt; after logging in. Click &amp;ldquo;Get Token&amp;rdquo;, click &amp;ldquo;Copy to clipboard&amp;rdquo;, and then paste it into &lt;code&gt;variables.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Save &lt;code&gt;variables.py&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: Don&amp;rsquo;t share either of these tokens with anyone else, as they will then be able to access your Shortform or Readwise accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;run-the-script&#34;&gt;Run the script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open up your terminal, and &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code&gt;/shortform-to-readwise&lt;/code&gt; repository. Then, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;python3 getHighlights.py
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should finish in a few seconds (depending on how many Shortform highlights you have), and then you can verify that it worked by going to &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/books&#34;&gt;your Readwise library&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20210816-shortform-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;Shortform exports showing up in your Readwise library&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shortform exports showing up in your Readwise library.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should see books that have the &lt;code&gt;Shortform-&lt;/code&gt; prefix. If you do, then you&amp;rsquo;re done! If you&amp;rsquo;ve got your Readwise account set up to push your highlights elsewhere (such as Obsidian), then you&amp;rsquo;re all set!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you&amp;rsquo;re wondering why I added the &lt;code&gt;Shortform-&lt;/code&gt; prefix, it&amp;rsquo;s because I often read the Shortform guide, and then read the book itself. Rather than end up in a sticky situation where the Shortform guide highlights might override the actual book highlights, I titled it differently so that I get two pages for the two sets of highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-running-the-script-regularly&#34;&gt;What about running the script regularly?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole point of this, at least for me, was to set it up so that I&amp;rsquo;ve got highlights going to Obsidian &lt;em&gt;automatically&lt;/em&gt;, without needing my intervention. What I did was to use &lt;code&gt;crontab&lt;/code&gt; on macOS to run the script every 30 minutes, but you can set up your own schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;give-cron-full-system-access&#34;&gt;Give cron full system access&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cron needs to have the right permissions to run scripts on your behalf, so you may have to go to System Preferences &amp;gt; Security &amp;amp; Privacy &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Full Disk Access on your laptop and add &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/cron&lt;/code&gt; to the &amp;ldquo;allowed&amp;rdquo; list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;find-the-path-for-your-python3-installation&#34;&gt;Find the path for your python3 installation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your terminal, run:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;which python3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will give you a path. For me, it was &lt;code&gt;/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/bin/python3&lt;/code&gt;. Copy this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;open-crontab&#34;&gt;Open crontab&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, from your terminal, run the command &lt;code&gt;env EDITOR=nano crontab -e&lt;/code&gt; to open up a list of cronjobs. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have any other jobs, this will be blank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;set-a-schedule&#34;&gt;Set a schedule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add a line to crontab for the schedule you want to create. This line has to be in the format&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;* * * * * command
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where the five asterisks correspond to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;day of the month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;day of the week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I wanted it to run every 30 minutes, so here&amp;rsquo;s what my schedule looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;*/30 * * * * /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/bin/python3 /Users/nic/python/shortform-to-readwise/gethighlights.py
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you change &lt;code&gt;/Users/nic/python/&lt;/code&gt; to the path where you put the repository and your python3 path instead of &lt;code&gt;/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/bin/python3&lt;/code&gt;. Now exit out of it and save it (CTRL+X, and yes). The Python script should automatically run every 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thats-it&#34;&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consume a lot of content daily, but without systems in place to capture insights from that content and process it, it all just gets forgotten eventually. That&amp;rsquo;s why I love services like Shortform and Readwise&amp;ndash; they let me get what I&amp;rsquo;ve read/watched/heard out of my head and into Obsidian, where I can review them more critically and truly learn the important parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are paid services (which I paid for out of my own money), but I really think they&amp;rsquo;re worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The easiest way to sync Kindle highlights to Obsidian: Readwise to Obsidian Redux</title>

&lt;meta property=“og:image” content=&#34;/assets/readwise-official-plugin.png&#34; /&gt;
&lt;meta property=”og:image:width” content=”1200″ /&gt;
&lt;meta property=”og:image:height” content=”628″ /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/readwise-official-plugin.png&#34; alt=&#34;Readwise to Obsidian workflow&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost exactly six months ago, I &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210206-readwise-to-obsidian/&#34;&gt;wrote a blog post&lt;/a&gt; detailing my workflow for processing content. Specifically, I wrote about how I used a python script to take my highlights from Instapaper, Kindle, Twitter, and Airr and automatically put them into Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That method worked, and you can read the original article in the link above. However, today, &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/nicole&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt; announced that they now have &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.readwise.io/article/125-how-does-the-readwise-to-obsidian-export-integration-work&#34;&gt;an official Obsidian community plugin&lt;/a&gt;, and I disabled my trusty old python script for good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, although my old script worked, there were quirks&amp;ndash; not the least of which was that making changes to it meant programming in Python. I&amp;rsquo;m not a developer, so while I made do, it was never a painless experience. I also ran into issues with time zones and invalid characters being used in titles. So I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to have something significantly better from Readwise itself! Here&amp;rsquo;s a video from the Readwise team, or read on for instructions on how to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DOYwwdDC9LQ&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;em&gt;From &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DOYwwdDC9LQ&#34;&gt;Readwise on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-the-obsidian-plugin&#34;&gt;Install the Obsidian plugin.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your Obsidian vault, go to Settings &amp;gt; Community plugins. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to turn Safe mode off for community plugins if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, click Browse and search for Readwise Official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/readwise-official.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of the Readwise Official plugin within Obsidian&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install it, and then enable it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;connect-your-readwise-account-to-the-obsidian-plugin&#34;&gt;Connect your Readwise account to the Obsidian plugin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head back to the Settings menu and scroll down to the &amp;ldquo;Plugin Options&amp;rdquo; section, and then click Readwise Official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/readwise-official-connect.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of the initial screen of the Readwise Official plugin&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click connect as highlighted in orange above, and a browser window will open, showing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/export/obsidian/preferences&#34;&gt;Obsidian Export&lt;/a&gt; options. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to sign into your Readwise account if you haven&amp;rsquo;t already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-export.png&#34; alt=&#34;Obsidian export page&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, your Readwise account will have been connected to the Readwise Official plugin, but you won&amp;rsquo;t have triggered any syncs yet. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to change any of the configuration settings, you can then skip ahead to triggering the sync on Obsidian, but let&amp;rsquo;s run through the options anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;modifying-configuration-settings&#34;&gt;Modifying configuration settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Obsidian Exports page, you&amp;rsquo;ll be presented with a few options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;group-files-in-category-folders&#34;&gt;Group Files in Category Folders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, this will be enabled. When enabled, Readwise will put your highlights in different folders depending on its source. For example, Kindle highlights will appear in the folder &lt;code&gt;Books&lt;/code&gt;. Disabling this option means all new notes will be created in the directory specified in the Obsidian plugin settings, which we&amp;rsquo;ll cover later. I left this enabled in case I read a book that has the same name as a blog post about the book, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;use-custom-formatting&#34;&gt;Use Custom Formatting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Custom formatting is disabled by default, and lets you choose how the final note looks. Here are the things you can change in this section&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page title&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Page metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlights header&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;YAML front matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sync notification&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did make some changes in this section just to tweak how I want information to be displayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;page-metadata&#34;&gt;Page metadata&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t see the need for Page metadata since this is what I use YAML front matter for, so I removed the matadata section and the document tags (I never use those either). So my Page metadata section looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;{% if image_url -%}
![rw-book-cover]({{image_url}})

{% endif -%}
{% if url -%}
URL: {{url}}
{% endif -%}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;Highlight&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, highlights are entered in bullet-point form. That&amp;rsquo;s fine when &lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m&lt;/em&gt; taking notes, but when I&amp;rsquo;m highlighting someone else&amp;rsquo;s words, I like to be very careful to use blockquotes. I frequently do block searches in Obsidian, and I do NOT want to accidentally pass off a quote as something I said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this end, I added a &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; before each highlight and two newlines (carriage returns) at the end to delineate each highlight. That way, I can quote just one highlight at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;gt; {{ highlight_text }}{% if highlight_location and highlight_location_url %} ([{{highlight_location}}]({{highlight_location_url}})){% elif highlight_location %} ({{highlight_location}}){% endif %}{% if highlight_note %}
    - Note: {{ highlight_note }}{% endif %}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see above, I also removed highlight tags, which I never use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;yaml-front-matter&#34;&gt;YAML front matter&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metadata has to be quite specific, so I added parameters I already use for other notes in this section. The &lt;code&gt;TVZ&lt;/code&gt; is a tag I use that means &amp;ldquo;To Verzettelen&amp;rdquo;, meaning pages that I need to process further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Title: {{full_title}}
Author: {{author}}
Tags: TVZ, readwise, {{category}}
date: {{date}}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;sync-notification&#34;&gt;Sync notification&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who has worked on a syncing plugin for Readwise to Obsidian, I know that things go wrong sometimes. Enabling this outputs a synchronization log to a note, which has come in handy MANY times in the past. &lt;em&gt;Has that book been synced, or did something go wrong?&lt;/em&gt; So I copied what the Readwise team suggested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;- [[{{date|date(&amp;#39;Y-m-d&amp;#39;)}}]] {{time}} — Synced {{num_highlights}} highlight{{num_highlights|pluralize}} from {{num_books}} document{{num_books|pluralize}}.
{% for book in books %}    - {{ book.num_highlights_added}} highlights from {{ book.title }}
{%endfor %}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;select-items-to-be-exported&#34;&gt;Select Items to be Exported&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this section, you can choose which books/podcasts/other content in Readwise you want to export. It is disabled by default. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t synced Readwise to Obsidian before, and you just want to pull in everything, leave it disabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I have already synchronized everything using the plugin I mentioned, and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to create another few hundred duplicate notes in my vault. So I enabled it and selected a few more recent books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A weird thing about this Export settings page is that there is no saving&amp;ndash; it just automatically saves it. Just a note, because I was scrolling up and down that page looking for an indication that it had been saved before I realized it is done automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;initiate-sync-from-obsidian&#34;&gt;Initiate Sync from Obsidian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head back to Obsidian and to the Readwise Official plugin options page. You should see a &amp;ldquo;Initiate Sync&amp;rdquo; button where the &amp;ldquo;Connect&amp;rdquo; one was before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/readwise-official-initiate.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Initiate Sync button&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a good sign - that means your Readwise account has been connected, and your configuration settings from the previous step will be fetched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you click the button, note that the &lt;em&gt;Customize base folder&lt;/em&gt; option is set to &lt;code&gt;Readwise&lt;/code&gt;. This is the directory that all your Readwise notes will be created. So if you enabled &lt;em&gt;Group Files in Category Folders&lt;/em&gt; earlier, your Kindle highlights will be saved in &lt;code&gt;Readwise/Books/booktitle.md&lt;/code&gt;. You can change the base folder if you prefer, but I just kept the default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to click the button!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/readwise-synced.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of synced status from Readwise plugin&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll see a few messages popping up on the upper right corner of your screen, and you&amp;rsquo;ll also see a &lt;em&gt;Synced!&lt;/em&gt; message appear next to the button you just clicked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;verifying-results&#34;&gt;Verifying results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In your Obsidian vault, search for one of the items you synced. Here&amp;rsquo;s what my note for Pat Flynn&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Superfans&lt;/em&gt; looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/readwise-obsidian-kindle.png&#34; alt=&#34;An example of Kindle highlights imported to Obsidian&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great! It looks exactly how I want it to look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;set-up-automatic-sync&#34;&gt;Set up automatic sync&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you leave it there, the plugin will only sync when you tell it to, so you&amp;rsquo;d need to go into the plugin options each time. That&amp;rsquo;s not particularly useful for me, because I want it to just happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel similarly, head back into Plugin Options one more time and select your desired frequency in the &lt;em&gt;Configure resync frequency&lt;/em&gt; dropdown menu. I chose 1 hour, the minimum. I also enabled the automatic sync when Obsidian opens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/readwise-official-auto-sync.png&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of auto sync options for Readwise Official plugin&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love this new plugin! It was very much needed, because existing options for accomplishing the same thing were flawed in some way, mainly because they were community-driven&amp;ndash; meaning the people who created these workarounds (myself included) were &amp;ldquo;just&amp;rdquo; users who had other jobs. I&amp;rsquo;m grateful that the Readwise team has acknowledged the popularity of Obsidian and taken on the maintenance burden. I&amp;rsquo;ve experimented with the plugin quite a bit and haven&amp;rsquo;t found any major issues so far. It is a seamless way to get the best of the content I&amp;rsquo;ve consumed from various sources into one single source of truth: Obsidian. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to streamline content processing and creation processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;meta property=“og:image” content=&#34;/assets/Forgotten-Realms-workspace-in-Obsidian.png&#34; /&gt;
&lt;meta property=”og:image:width” content=”1200″ /&gt;
&lt;meta property=”og:image:height” content=”628″ /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve previously written about &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210518-how-i-use-obsidian-at-work/&#34;&gt;how I use Obsidian for work&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also talked about &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20201214-roam-for-dnd/&#34;&gt;how I use Roam Research for D&amp;amp;D&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after the latter post, however, I moved to Obsidian. That was six months ago, so I thought it was time for an update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;before-the-game&#34;&gt;Before the game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;world&#34;&gt;World&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My World page is the main jumping-off point for all my notes for a specific campaign, and each campaign gets one. It contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main locations in the world&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The player characters, and links to their individual pages with information about what my character knows or thinks of them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A link to Open Loops (Quests and Questions and Agenda, as discussed below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The list of all the sessions I&amp;rsquo;ve played for the campaign&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Campaign-specific house rules that the DM has introduced&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/world-page.png&#34; alt=&#34;The World page for my Forgotten Realms campaign&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;quests-and-questions&#34;&gt;Quests and Questions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to play high-intelligence characters, so I like to keep track of unanswered questions and other adventure hooks my DM has dropped that the party hasn&amp;rsquo;t quite gotten around to resolving yet. Some of them are critical quest or story arcs, and others are random tidbits of information that NPCs have mentioned. I organize them by location, and then by quest, so that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to follow a thread depending on where the party is or how much downtime we have. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of that page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/quests-and-questions.png&#34; alt=&#34;Quests and Questions page&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;agenda&#34;&gt;Agenda&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Quests and Questions page records unfinished business that my character is actively thinking about but may not quite know how to explore yet, my Agenda page is where I write down specific tasks. I loosely follow the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gettingthingsdone.com/&#34;&gt;Getting Things Done&lt;/a&gt; methodology and divide this page into Next Actions and Waiting For. I group tasks by person and/or by location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/Agenda-sample.png&#34; alt=&#34;Agenda page&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the Obsidian &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/DahaWong/obsidian-completed-area&#34;&gt;Completed Area plugin&lt;/a&gt; so that hitting a CTRL + ENTER on a task automatically checks it and then moves that task to a separate Completed section at the bottom of the note. This helps me keep the agenda clean and relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;during-a-game&#34;&gt;During a game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;workspace&#34;&gt;Workspace&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best parts about Obsidian is that it allows me to save and load custom workspaces. This is useful because I use Obsidian for work as well as play, so I can set up the two workspaces differently. I also DM one campaign and play in another, and I have a workspace for each of them because I need different information available to me. The workspace features lets me customize my dashboard. Here&amp;rsquo;s what my workspace looks like for the 4e game that I play in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/Forgotten-Realms-workspace-in-Obsidian.png&#34; alt=&#34;My Forgotten Realms campaign workspace in Obsidian&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of a game, I&amp;rsquo;ll create a new session page in the last pane, enter into it, and then stay in the workspace for the rest of the game. I have my character&amp;rsquo;s stats sheet handy (which I need to do manually since I haven&amp;rsquo;t found a D&amp;amp;D Beyond-like service for 4e) and all the powers and abilities I need to refer to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;session-template&#34;&gt;Session template&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love Obsidian templates! I use templates for things like inserting an HP tracker with all my party&amp;rsquo;s names, their max HP, healing surges (4e); a defense table to keep track of a creature&amp;rsquo;s defenses (again, 4e); and campaign-specific session log formats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the game, I&amp;rsquo;ll create a new page in the Session List, click into it, and insert a session log template (I have this hotkeyed to CMD+&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;). Here&amp;rsquo;s what a fresh one looks like, in Edit mode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/session-template-fresh.png&#34; alt=&#34;My session template, newly inserted&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I add metadata to every session so that I can query it later using the excellent &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview&#34;&gt;Obsidian Dataview plugin&lt;/a&gt;, though I do this more often for the campaign I DM rather than the one I play in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We usually do a recap at the beginning of the game, so I jump into the &lt;code&gt;Recap of the last session&lt;/code&gt; section and embed the summary from the previous session using &lt;code&gt; ![](/assets/86_20210717 Day 16 Hunting the Ice Phase Spider#^summary)&lt;/code&gt;, which pulls in the section marked with &lt;code&gt;^summary&lt;/code&gt; from the last session. That embeds just that portion of the last session in the current session, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/Recap.png&#34; alt=&#34;Session recap using block embed&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This helps me get back up to speed quickly instead of doing the usual &amp;ldquo;Where were we again?&amp;rdquo; that takes up time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hp-table&#34;&gt;HP table&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My character is a multiclassed healer, so it&amp;rsquo;s important for me to know who needs heals or other buffs. I keep track of this separately, and it helps out my DM as well because it&amp;rsquo;s easy to miss something in the excitement of a battle. I do include the HP table in my workspace, in Preview mode, but here&amp;rsquo;s what it looks like in Edit mode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/HP-table.png&#34; alt=&#34;A table of the party&amp;amp;rsquo;s HP, surges, and conditions&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tables in Markdown can be a pain, but the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian&#34;&gt;Advanced Tables plugin&lt;/a&gt; goes a long way towards making this easier by adding some nice features like tabbing to the next cell, adding commands for inserting and deleting a column or row, and just automatically formatting a table so that it&amp;rsquo;s not a jumble of lines. I also heavily use this plugin for my characters stats and skills, both of which I keep in tables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;keeping-track-of-fights&#34;&gt;Keeping track of fights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a fight breaks out, I insert an intiative template, which is just a list of all the characters in the party:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Initiative!
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Ka&amp;#39;ira
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Maestro
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Xio
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Eraithe
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; Keren
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes it easier to add the initiative value rolled, as well as that of any other baddies we&amp;rsquo;re fighting. I use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vslinko/obsidian-outliner&#34;&gt;Outliner plugin&lt;/a&gt; to be able to easily move people on the list up or down as needed without having to copy or paste. I have the shortcuts set to CMD+SHIFT+UP and CMD+SHIFT+DOWN so I don&amp;rsquo;t even need to use my mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also have a template for Defenses. D&amp;amp;D 4th Edition has four different kinds of defenses, and since my character&amp;rsquo;s powers target a few of them, I keep track of the defenses of each monster. Here&amp;rsquo;s what that template looks like, in Edit mode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;| Defense               | Value |
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;| --------------------- | ----- |
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;| [[Reflex Defense]]    |       |
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;| [[Fortitude Defense]] |       |
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;| [[Will Defense]]      |       |
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;| [[Armor Class]]       |       |
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll notice that I also link to the pages I have for each defense type, in case I need to remind myself which stat a defense is comprised of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;character-powers&#34;&gt;Character powers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many, I have migrated from playing games on a literal tabletop to doing it virtually. These days, I play 100% online, using a bunch of different tools. For the most part, though, I still prefer to roll actual dice. There&amp;rsquo;s just something satisfying about the feel of a die in my hand. Since I switched to Obsidian, though, I have looked into virtual dice. On the off chance I don&amp;rsquo;t have any dice (ha) or all my dice have betrayed me (much more likely), I use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-dice-roller&#34;&gt;Dice Roller plugin&lt;/a&gt;. It turns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`dice: 1d20+7`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;into a random die roll. Here it is when incorporated into my character&amp;rsquo;s list of powers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/powers-sample.png&#34; alt=&#34;My character&amp;amp;rsquo;s powers page&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when I&amp;rsquo;m feeling superstitious about my dice, I&amp;rsquo;ll switch to using this dice roller &amp;ldquo;just to be safe&amp;rdquo;. It has other cool features too, which I&amp;rsquo;ll cover more in detail in the Dungeon Master&amp;rsquo;s edition of this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;search-linked-unlinked-mentions&#34;&gt;Search, linked, unlinked mentions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frequently, something comes up in a game that I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; we&amp;rsquo;ve heard of before, but I can&amp;rsquo;t quite remember where or when. Actually, sometimes something comes up that I&amp;rsquo;m quite sure we&amp;rsquo;ve &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; heard of before, but it turns out we have. Luckily, Obsidian is quick to tell me that using the linked/unlinked mentions and the search features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the mentions in my note for the word &amp;ldquo;Netheril&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/Netheril-mentions.png&#34; alt=&#34;Linked mentioned for the word Netheril&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlinked mentions show up too, in case the word came up somewhere and I didn&amp;rsquo;t think to specifically create a page on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On monster pages, mentions remind me when we fought them last, and any tips for fighting them. It can be handy when one of the other players has forgotten something that happened to them, too. If I want to remember how Ka&amp;rsquo;ira got her festering wound, I can type it into the Obsidian search bar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/festering-wound.png&#34; alt=&#34;A search in Obsidian for &amp;amp;ldquo;festering wound&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and be able to confidently say that Ka&amp;rsquo;ira got her last festering wound on session 68, in the Blue Crystal Fortress that we now know to be the Twisted Fane, while fighting aberrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;after-a-game&#34;&gt;After a game&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I might use Obsidian even more between games than during the game, because after the game is when I process everything my character learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;session-summary&#34;&gt;Session summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after the game is when I create a short session summary. I like to do this when the session is still fresh in my mind. Then, I add &lt;code&gt;^summary&lt;/code&gt; at the end of the paragraph to identify it and to be able to pull it into the next session&amp;rsquo;s recap. Block references and block embeds are some of my most frequently used Obsidian features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;creating-new-pages&#34;&gt;Creating new pages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then create new pages for any people, places, magical items, or events that we encountered. I like to use a standard frontmatter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;---
type: 
location: [Neverwinter]
world: &amp;#34;Forgotten Realms&amp;#34;
campaign: &amp;#34;Order of the Wandering Mind&amp;#34;
date: 2021-06-23
---
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of the page for an NPC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/npc-sample.png&#34; alt=&#34;An NPC page in my campaign&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If my DM has given us character art, I include it in the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s an example of a page for a location:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/twisted-fane-location-example.png&#34; alt=&#34;Location page: Twisted Fane&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this page, I used a plugin called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/valentine195/obsidian-leaflet-plugin&#34;&gt;Obsidian Leaflet&lt;/a&gt;, which lets me add maps to my notes! In this case, my DM gave us this map of the structure as a guide, but during combats we didn&amp;rsquo;t use a map. To keep myself oriented between games, I added red pawprint pins where we had spotted or fought monsters, green thumbtacks to mark where we&amp;rsquo;d ended sessions, and green markers where we had spotted allies. I also like to add links to monsters or sessions on the pins/markers so that I can jump to those pages quickly if I need to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;history&#34;&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep historical events straight in my head, especially since we tend to discover them out of sequence, I use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Darakah/obsidian-timelines&#34;&gt;Obsidian Timelines plugin&lt;/a&gt;, which lets me create pages like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-timeline-for-dnd.png&#34; alt=&#34;Obsidian Timeline in my game&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by using this code in the timeline page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;```timeline
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;fr
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;\```
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;(without the backtick) and this for every event that I want to include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;---
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;date: [2021-06-23]

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;          &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;data-img &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;assets/xionerys.jpg&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;data-type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;range&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;data-end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;1443-00&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;	Xionerys is born in Calimshan.
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;span&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using this method, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to call out discrepancies in what two different NPCs told us and figure out that one was lying&amp;ndash; or at least misinformed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;replace-all&#34;&gt;Replace all&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I inevitably get a fantasy name wrong, having pages as flat .md files is great because I can do a find and replace on ALL mentions of a certain NPC name/place I&amp;rsquo;ve misspelled (those fantasy names!). I do this with my usual code/text editor, VSCode, just because I usually already have it up, but you can do it using terminal commands. If it&amp;rsquo;s just the name of a page, updating the spelling in Obsidian changes it everywhere else it&amp;rsquo;s linked to as well, which is useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;updating-open-loops&#34;&gt;Updating open loops&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To finish processing the last session, I update Open Loops: I add new points or update existing points in Quests and Questions, and then add tasks to Agenda that I want to do in the next session. I find that it&amp;rsquo;s best to do it after a game because it&amp;rsquo;s a week, sometimes more, between games and there&amp;rsquo;s a high likelihood I&amp;rsquo;ll have forgotten what I want to do by then!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;publish&#34;&gt;Publish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also publish my D&amp;amp;D notes, just for transparency. My DM has joked that he looks in there sometimes when he&amp;rsquo;s forgotten something. Even if he doesn&amp;rsquo;t, I enjoy having my notes so easily accessible. I often navigate there myself when I have a spare moment, remembering old sessions and thinking about some loose threads. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested, &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/TTRPGs/Order+of+the+Wandering+Mind/World&#34;&gt;here they are&lt;/a&gt;! Just be warned that the plugins won&amp;rsquo;t work in the web version, so sometimes you&amp;rsquo;ll come across bits of code that didn&amp;rsquo;t render. I also migrated these notes from Roam Research, and haven&amp;rsquo;t gone back and updated all the older notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I&amp;rsquo;ve switched to Obsidian, it&amp;rsquo;s been an indispensable part of my workflow for D&amp;amp;D. Without it, I&amp;rsquo;d be just another murder hobo with no notes. And no DM wants that!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Downloading files uploaded to Roam Research for use with Obsidian</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210602-downloading-files-from-roam/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Jun 2021 00:27:59 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210602-downloading-files-from-roam/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve recently transitioned from &lt;a href=&#34;https://roamresearch.com&#34;&gt;Roam Research&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, you might run into a few issues, even after you&amp;rsquo;ve run the &amp;ldquo;Markdown format importer&amp;rdquo; core plugin. One of the most annoying ones that I ran into was that files uploaded to Roam (images, pdfs, etc.) are automatically uploaded to &lt;a href=&#34;https://firebase.google.com/&#34;&gt;Google Firebase&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roam assets are linked to in the Markdown files like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-471a1.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMyNotes%2FxRFXx7l-ZK.png?alt=media&lt;span style=&#34;color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;token=1e03b680-5472-33dc-9b06-a127301af37f)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, since Roam relies on security by obscurity on this front, the links to your assets will still be accessible in your Obsidian vault, and they&amp;rsquo;ll still render correctly. However, I still think it&amp;rsquo;s worth downloading the files for three reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t intend to use Roam anymore and cancel your subscription, they will likely delete those assets at some point, leaving you with a lot of broken links in Obsidian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Part of Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s appeal is that you own your assets. Not so if they&amp;rsquo;re on someone else&amp;rsquo;s server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t access Firebase files without an internet connection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, instead, you want to download the contents of that link and replace it in your notes with something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;![](assets/newfile.png)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That way, you&amp;rsquo;ll have full control over all your assets, and you won&amp;rsquo;t be dependent on those assets being stored on Firebase by Roam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fix this, I wrote a Python script that will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go through every file and every folder within a specified root vault directory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look for links to Google Firebase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download all assets from Firebase to a local folder (&lt;code&gt;/assets&lt;/code&gt; by default), using the timestamp and index number as a filename&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Replace the Firebase links in your vault with links to the newly downloaded files, accounting for PDFs, whose links are formatted differently in Roam as &lt;code&gt;{{ pdf: ... }}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you run this script, I highly recommend backing up your vault or trying this out on a dummy vault.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/b25c97a8a68ea97e7bdf5ee674fdaec4.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After downloading and saving the script, run &lt;code&gt;python3 downloadfirebase.py&lt;/code&gt; on your terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This worked really well for me, and I can breathe a little more easily now that my vault is self-contained.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Interview on Performance Time Podcast</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210531-performance-time/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 May 2021 11:28:18 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210531-performance-time/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I first heard of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/perftestnz&#34;&gt;Stephen Townshend&lt;/a&gt; because he happens to have gotten the same introduction to performance testing that I did&amp;ndash; our shared mentor, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/stijnschepers/&#34;&gt;Stijn Schephers&lt;/a&gt;. He has started a podcast called Performance Time, where he interviews performance engineers about a variety of topics. This week, it was me!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/3pp3ZFFB8DyfUEtLRuLxGe&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;232&#34; frameBorder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked about how I got started, one of my biggest failures as a performance tester, chaos engineering, what we can do to improve diversity in tech, and why I think note-taking is a key skill for any performance tester.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I Use Obsidian at Work</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210518-how-i-use-obsidian-at-work/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 May 2021 22:33:18 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210518-how-i-use-obsidian-at-work/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note-taking and personal knowledge management get talked about in academic circles, by both students and teachers. But there&amp;rsquo;s not much said about its use outside of the academe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/graphview-transparent.png&#34; alt=&#34;Obsidian for work&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, due to my job description, I may be in a better position than most to take advantage of note-taking in a professional context. My background is in software performance testing. My job for several years has been to make sure that applications are prepared to withstand traffic from many users accessing it, usually by writing code to simulate that traffic before it&amp;rsquo;s released to real users. Currently, though, I&amp;rsquo;m a Developer Advocate at &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io&#34;&gt;k6.io&lt;/a&gt;, which means a significant part of my job now is sharing with people what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider myself a knowledge worker: a significant part of my job depends on how quickly I learn new technologies &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; how clearly I can impart what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to others. I&amp;rsquo;d argue, though, that most people who work in a field as fast-moving as tech are knowledge workers too. It&amp;rsquo;s naive to think we won&amp;rsquo;t one day forget some skills we&amp;rsquo;ve learned, even if we were using them daily at one point. Yet nobody talks about note-taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, my note-taking and personal knowledge management tool of choice has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian.md&lt;/a&gt;. I have no affiliation with the Obsidian team, and in fact I&amp;rsquo;m an investor of &lt;a href=&#34;https://roamresearch.com&#34;&gt;a competing product&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some ways I use Obsidian at work that might help you understand why Obsidian is my daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-setup&#34;&gt;My setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have multiple Obsidian vaults, and each of them is a version-controlled &lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/&#34;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; repository, hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I keep my main Obsidian vault in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://dropbox.com&#34;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; for extra version control and as a backup. Just for overkill, I also use &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md/sync&#34;&gt;Obsidian Sync&lt;/a&gt; as another backup and as the easiest way to get access to my Obsidian vault on my iPad Pro and my Android mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md/publish&#34;&gt;Obsidian Publish&lt;/a&gt; to make some of my notes &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com&#34;&gt;publicly available&lt;/a&gt; on a custom domain directly from my vault, as an experiment in learning in public that&amp;rsquo;s gone pretty well so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This setup isn&amp;rsquo;t free. All up, I&amp;rsquo;m giving Obsidian about US $16 a month. However, I want to point out that Obsidian itself is free for personal use, and if mobile access, cloud sync, and publishing your notes online aren&amp;rsquo;t important to you, you can really go a long way with using it for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;processing-information&#34;&gt;Processing information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining relevant in tech pretty much requires that you learn a lot, learn quickly, and enjoy the hell out of it. Luckily, Obsidian is pretty great at this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;consume-and-collect&#34;&gt;Consume and collect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consume a lot of content, and in different formats: articles, books, videos, presentations, podcasts are all great sources of free education. I initially capture my notes on them in different ways, but they all lead back to using &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt;, which I use as a collector and sorter of all these notes. Then, I import data from Readwise to Obsidian using a process I describe in more detail &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210206-readwise-to-obsidian/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, suffice it to say that all these notes and highlights end up in Obsidian for processing. &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Presentation/In+the+kitchen+-+a+sprinkle+of+fire+and+chaos&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of my notes during a presentation&lt;/a&gt; (called &lt;em&gt;In the kitchen - a sprinkle of fire and chaos&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.anammedina.com/&#34;&gt;Ana Medina&lt;/a&gt;, about chaos engineering).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When trying to learn something, many people stop at this phase. They&amp;rsquo;ve read the thing, they&amp;rsquo;ve highlighted passages from the thing, and now they think they&amp;rsquo;ve learned the thing. That hasn&amp;rsquo;t been my experience, because I forget many things I consume shallowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;process-iteratively&#34;&gt;Process iteratively&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I process notes iteratively, first restating things into my own words and then creating my own notes about concepts I&amp;rsquo;ve learned. Each time I do that, I try to identify key concepts and create backlinks for them, which in Obsidian just means typing &lt;code&gt;[[Chaos engineering]]&lt;/code&gt;, with a topic between double brackets. If I click on that new link, it creates  a page for it. Over time, I end up with a page &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Chaos+Engineering&#34;&gt;like this one on Chaos Engineering&lt;/a&gt; that is a consolidation of what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, if I go to the Chaos Engineering page, I can also see all the instances I&amp;rsquo;ve linked to it from other notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/linked-mentions.png&#34; alt=&#34;Linked mentions in Obsidian&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the foresight to link to Chaos Engineering from an article I read? Obsidian also tracks &lt;em&gt;unlinked&lt;/em&gt; mentions as well. I can see all the times I&amp;rsquo;ve used the words &amp;ldquo;chaos engineering&amp;rdquo; in other notes, even if I haven&amp;rsquo;t created formal links using &lt;code&gt;[[Chaos engineering]]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, things I&amp;rsquo;m interested in start to emerge this way, and topics grow deeper and more detailed, with branches of pages spinning off from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;situate-and-solidify&#34;&gt;Situate and solidify&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I try to think about where this new piece of knowledge fits into the hierarchy of things I&amp;rsquo;m interested in. This is less about trying to classify the world and more about putting it somewhere on &lt;em&gt;my personal&lt;/em&gt; map of interests so that I&amp;rsquo;m more likely to use that knowledge later. For me, chaos engineering fit into my page on &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Nonfunctional+testing&#34;&gt;Nonfunctional testing&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so helps me pit it against other things I&amp;rsquo;ve classified as forms of nonfunctional testing and think critically about whether it belongs there, or whether other things I already know contradict it in some way. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll make notes about my reasoning for classification, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Chaos+engineering+is+a+testing+discipline&#34;&gt;this note on why I think chaos engineering is a testing discipline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is set in stone. I&amp;rsquo;m always changing notes around as I learn more things that change my mind. For example, I&amp;rsquo;m considering merging my nonfunctional testing and functional testing pages after a conversation where someone questioned whether it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a misnomer to call application performance &amp;ldquo;nonfunctional&amp;rdquo;. The point is to create a living, breathing second brain that helps me make connections between concepts and remember what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s built-in graph view illustrates this point nicely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/graph_view-20210518.png&#34; alt=&#34;Built-in graph view&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my main Obsidian vault as of the time of this writing - all 5443 notes of it. The graph view plots every note and the connections between notes, so I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up with a slick visual representation of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking and writing about. The graph view is actually &lt;em&gt;functional&lt;/em&gt;, too&amp;ndash; I can assign colors to nodes based on the directory they&amp;rsquo;re in, their tags, words they can contain, and a lot of other criteria. Because each node is sized according to how many links lead to it, this view makes it easy to see clusters in things I&amp;rsquo;ve thought or written about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;publish&#34;&gt;Publish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the advantages of Obsidian over something like Notion or Roam Research is how easy it is to publish notes from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;obsidian-publish-paid&#34;&gt;Obsidian Publish (paid)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s the paid Publish service, which I&amp;rsquo;ve subscribed to for US $8 a month. After &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Using+a+custom+domain+with+Obsidian+Publish&#34;&gt;setting it up to publish on my own domain&lt;/a&gt; rather than the default at &lt;code&gt;publish.obsidian.md&lt;/code&gt;, going from a note to a published post is as easy as clicking the Publish icon, selecting the notes to add, delete, or modify, and then selecting Publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/publish-dialog.png&#34; alt=&#34;Dialog for Obsidian Publish&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;open-folder-as-vault&#34;&gt;Open folder as vault&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to pay for Publish, Obsidian still saves all files locally in Markdown (&lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt;) format. This is the same format that many static site generators take for content. This site that you&amp;rsquo;re reading this on is generated using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, so everything written here is kept as a Markdown file before it&amp;rsquo;s turned into HTML. Since an &amp;ldquo;Obsidian vault&amp;rdquo; is just a folder with Markdown files, I can just open the directory containing the files for my site and write blog posts in Obsidian with no noticeable difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, we happen to store our main &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/&#34;&gt;product documentation&lt;/a&gt; as Markdown files in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/k6io/docs&#34;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;, which make it perfect for opening in Obsidian as well. I prefer to write documentation in Obsidian over VSCode for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can install plugins, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian&#34;&gt;Advanced Tables&lt;/a&gt; to make Markdown tables easier to deal with, create templates to standardize the format of notes you make often, see an outline of what you&amp;rsquo;re writing based on Markdown headings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/outlines-obsidian.png&#34; alt=&#34;See an outline of your current note&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Outline core plugin for Obsidian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I want to link to another page, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to just hit CMD + O to search through existing notes instead of finding it on GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can choose an Obsidian theme that matches the theme of the published site. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ishgunacar/gitsidian&#34;&gt;This &amp;ldquo;Gitsidian&amp;rdquo; theme&lt;/a&gt; has an Edit view in dark mode (my preference) but a rendered Preview mode that looks more like GitHub&amp;rsquo;s Markdown format, so I can see what it will actually look like for users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/ishgunacar/gitsidian/raw/master/showcase.png&#34; alt=&#34;Gitsidian theme preview for Obsidian&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m done, I can still jump to my terminal and push my change to GitHub as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;obsidian-uris&#34;&gt;Obsidian URIs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another cool feature is the fact that every note in Obsidian has what&amp;rsquo;s called an Obsidian URI - it&amp;rsquo;s a link that opens up a note within a specified vault. The URI looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;obsidian://open?vault=docs&amp;amp;file=src%2Fdata%2Fmarkdown%2Fdocs%2F03%20cloud%2F02%20Analyzing%20Results%2F02%20Performance%20Insights&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding it and publishing that to internal documentation means I can switch easily from browsing on GitHub to modifying the same page in Obsidian on my local machine, which is a great little bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;embedding-published-work&#34;&gt;Embedding published work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After publishing, I use iframes in Obsidian to update my notes with the final result. Here&amp;rsquo;s a video on YouTube about chaos engineering that my colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I planned out collaboratively on Obsidian, embedded into Obsidian:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/embedded-youtube-iframe.png&#34; alt=&#34;Embedding a video in an iframe&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video plays in Obsidian with all the same controls. The Obsidian desktop app is an Electron app, so it behaves just like a normal browser for playing back the video. To embed the video, I just used the Share &amp;gt; Embed code on YouTube and pasted it straight into Obsidian:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;iframe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;560&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;315&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gVwJZPo30rk&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;YouTube video player&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;frameborder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;0&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;allow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;allowfullscreen&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;iframe&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;meetings&#34;&gt;Meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take meeting notes to help me focus on the meeting, and I create templates for recurring meetings. Templates let you define the format of a note. Once created, you can insert templates into notes with a keyboard shortcut (I set mine to &lt;code&gt;CMD + ;&lt;/code&gt;). Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of what that looks like, with the template on the left and the inserted template on the right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-meeting-templates.png&#34; alt=&#34;Template (left) and inserted template in a new note (right) in Obsidian&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Template (left) and inserted template in a new note (right) in Obsidian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may notice that the frontmatter includes &lt;code&gt;{{date}}&lt;/code&gt; in the template, which gets automatically converted to today&amp;rsquo;s date when the template is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone asks for a copy of my meeting notes, that&amp;rsquo;s no problem&amp;ndash; any note can be exported to Obsidian by clicking on Options &amp;gt; Export to PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-pdf-export.png&#34; alt=&#34;Options for exporting a note to a PDF in Obsidian&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Options for exporting a note to a PDF in Obsidian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to actually publish any real meeting notes, so here&amp;rsquo;s what my note on the chaos engineering process looks like &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/assets/The%20process%20of%20chaos%20engineering.pdf&#34;&gt;as a PDF&lt;/a&gt;, straight from Obsidian. And here&amp;rsquo;s what it looks like &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/The+process+of+chaos+engineering&#34;&gt;as a note&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;presentations&#34;&gt;Presentations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-easier-way&#34;&gt;The easier way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian has a presentation mode! It&amp;rsquo;s basic, but it&amp;rsquo;s functional. You can create a presentation really easily by adding &lt;code&gt;---&lt;/code&gt; between paragraphs of text to delineate slides, right within a note. Here&amp;rsquo;s what that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-slides-markdown.png&#34; alt=&#34;Creating a presentation from Markdown notes&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you can click Options &amp;gt; Start presentation, and you get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-slides.png&#34; alt=&#34;An Obsidian presentation&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little plain, but given the minimal amount of effort to &amp;ldquo;convert&amp;rdquo; a note into a presentation, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-harder-way&#34;&gt;The harder way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the basic slides just don&amp;rsquo;t cut it, and it can be handy to be able to publish the slides in presentation format (since publishing them straight from Obsidian Publish would only publish the Markdown version). For those cases, I&amp;rsquo;ve figured out a way to do just that while still keeping my slides as Markdown files in my vault. &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210302-presentation-slides-as-code/&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a whole post on how to do that&lt;/a&gt;. This is definitely more complicated, but at the end of it, you get a nice page &lt;a href=&#34;https://slides.nicolevanderhoeven.com/2021-load-tests-as-code/#/&#34;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt; to send to attendees after a presentation. (&lt;em&gt;Tip: Hit &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; to see the speaker notes while on those slides.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20210302-reveal-hugo-sample.png&#34; alt=&#34;A sample custom slide using revealJS with Obsidian&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-management&#34;&gt;Task management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a few community plugins to keep track of things I want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;kanban&#34;&gt;Kanban&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban&#34;&gt;Kanban plugin&lt;/a&gt; turns Markdown task lists into full-on Kanban boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-kanban.png&#34; alt=&#34;Kanban plugin in action&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the left is the markdown note, and the on the right is the rendered Kanban board. You can customize the titles of the lists that are there, and you can add due dates to each task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;calendar&#34;&gt;Calendar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin&#34;&gt;Calendar plugin&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo6BKY2xR2w&#34;&gt;Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s most popular plugin&lt;/a&gt;, and with good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It lets me add a calendar on the sidebar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-calendar.png&#34; alt=&#34;Obsidian calendar&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the weekly notes option enabled, so clicking on the &lt;code&gt;W&lt;/code&gt; column in the calendar takes me to a note that is automatically created for that week. I use it to keep track of weekly goals and to do a review at the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking on a date in the calendar takes me to the&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;daily-note&#34;&gt;Daily Note&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Daily Notes core plugin comes with Obsidian, but you have to enable it. Once enabled, clicking on a day in the calendar creates/takes you to that day&amp;rsquo;s corresponding note. I use daily notes like a log or workbench for that day, with timestamped headings to help me remember later on what I did at what time. It&amp;rsquo;s a loose way to do time management as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dataview&#34;&gt;Dataview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview&#34;&gt;Dataview plugin&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite recent discovery, and it&amp;rsquo;s changing the way I do frontmatter. This plugin brings something akin to SQL (albeit not as powerful) to Obsidian. It lets you query your notes based on some file-related metadata &lt;strong&gt;as well as parameters you set in your frontmatter&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, this query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-dataview&#34; data-lang=&#34;dataview&#34;&gt;table file.ctime as Date
from &amp;#34;Meeting&amp;#34;
where file.ctime &amp;gt;= date(today) -dur(1 month)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;when rendered (i.e., viewed in Preview mode in Obsidian), returns a list of all my notes under the subfolder &lt;code&gt;Meeting&lt;/code&gt; in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-dataview-meetings.png&#34; alt=&#34;Obsidian Dataview results as a table&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is huge! I&amp;rsquo;m still updating my notes with the appropriate frontmatter to make more use of this feature, but here are some use cases I can think of that would be handy at work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find all customers with tag &lt;code&gt;annual&lt;/code&gt; that I haven&amp;rsquo;t spoken to in the last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a load testing tool with feature &lt;code&gt;Slack_integration = true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find that woman I met at the Automation Test Guild conference by searching for &lt;code&gt;job = tester&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tag = AutomationTestGuild&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return all notes tagged &lt;code&gt;#plugin_ideas&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s just the beginning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;collaboration&#34;&gt;Collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian itself does not (yet) have collaboration features. This is a bummer, but given how quickly they&amp;rsquo;ve delivered on features that the community has clamored for (block references and mobile apps come immediately to mind), I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful that they&amp;rsquo;ll eventually improve in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;ve still found ways to work on the same vault with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember how any folder of .md files can be opened as an Obsidian vault? Well, I&amp;rsquo;m technically collaborating with other people on that repo for work documentation, even if most people don&amp;rsquo;t use Obsidian. All I had to do was add the &lt;code&gt;.obsidian&lt;/code&gt; directory to the &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file, and now, nobody really even needs to know I&amp;rsquo;m using Obsidian to view/edit the documentation. They just see me pushing to the repository as if I had used a text editor like VSCode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also had the experience of collaborating with someone who also used Obsidian. Since we were working closely together on the same document, we opted to put our shared vault on Dropbox. Dropbox&amp;rsquo;s main advantage over the Git solution is that Dropbox let us edit notes and see each other&amp;rsquo;s edits in real time. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for an experience similar to Google Docs, this way got the closest to that. We did run into some quirks: if the Dropbox vault is also a Git repository, be aware that checking out a different branch will also change the contents of the directory for the other person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note-taking and personal management aren&amp;rsquo;t just for students and teachers; I think they&amp;rsquo;re particularly useful in tech, where knowledge work is highly prized. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about Obsidian because that&amp;rsquo;s my current tool of choice, but I think the tool you use is less important than the systems you put in place to help yourself learn and create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d prefer the video version, here&amp;rsquo;s a video I made showing this process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/D7e1ud_Dk24&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Presentation Slides as Code</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210302-presentation-slides-as-code/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 02 Mar 2021 19:07:31 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210302-presentation-slides-as-code/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was working on a presentation for later this month when &lt;a href=&#34;https://mariedrake.com&#34;&gt;Marie Drake&lt;/a&gt; told me about &lt;a href=&#34;https://slides.com&#34;&gt;slides.com&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a Powerpoint replacement (which, let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, needs replacing) in that it lets you create slides &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; it lets you present from it. It even goes beyond Powerpoint in that it also saves your slides publicly for people to view later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before she&amp;rsquo;d mentioned slides.com, I had been planning on creating a presentation on &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, my note-taking tool of choice. The advantage of this approach is that presentations in Obsidian are just Markdown files with &lt;code&gt;---&lt;/code&gt; between lines of text to delineate slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with using Obsidian on its own is that it&amp;rsquo;s severely lacking in features, and it&amp;rsquo;s also not shareable. You can, of course, publish the Markdown file, but people won&amp;rsquo;t be able to view them in slide format. After playing with slides.com, however, I also discovered it had its own weaknesses. It is completely UI-driven, so there&amp;rsquo;s no way to create slides just from a Markdown file. It&amp;rsquo;s also hosted by them, so there are limitations imposed, depending on which pricing tier you pay for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I got to Googling. And I think I found a pretty good setup for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-end-result&#34;&gt;The end result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I write the presentation in Obsidian, in Markdown. &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/752017196efc1ee861c6d3baa5dfca31&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; what that looks like in a sample presentation where I&amp;rsquo;m trying out a bunch of features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; to generate a static website and convert the Markdown files into javascript and html, using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js&#34;&gt;reveal.js&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dzello/reveal-hugo&#34;&gt;reveal-hugo&lt;/a&gt; theme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I push the static website to a remote repository on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://pages.github.com/&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; serves that site (for free!) on my custom subdomain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the final product here:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://slides.nicolevanderhoeven.com/sample&#34;&gt;https://slides.nicolevanderhoeven.com/sample&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20210302-reveal-hugo-sample.png&#34; alt=&#34;A screenshot of the title presentation slide&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-setup&#34;&gt;The setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prerequisites&#34;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An Obsidian vault (or you can actually just use any text editor)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Git installed and set up with credentials&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A GitHub account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hugo installation (&lt;code&gt;brew install hugo&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;create-a-new-hugo-site&#34;&gt;Create a new Hugo site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open up a terminal window and &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to a folder in your Obsidian vault. Then, create a new Hugo-generated site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;hugo new site slides
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replace &lt;code&gt;slides&lt;/code&gt; with the name of your new site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should have a new directory, &lt;code&gt;slides&lt;/code&gt;, in your Obsidian vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-the-reveal-hugo-theme&#34;&gt;Add the reveal-hugo theme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;slides&lt;/code&gt; and clone the reveal-hugo repo. The documentation suggests using a submodule:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;git submodule add git@github.com:dzello/reveal-hugo.git themes/reveal-hugo
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I just cloned it because I know I&amp;rsquo;m probably going to be messing around with it substantially:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;git clone git@github.com:dzello/reveal-hugo.git themes/reveal-hugo
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should have a &lt;code&gt;/themes/reveal-hugo&lt;/code&gt; folder that contains the theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;configure-reveal-hugo-theme&#34;&gt;Configure reveal-hugo theme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set up your new Hugo site to use the reveal-hugo theme by adding the following to &lt;code&gt;/config.toml&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34; data-lang=&#34;yaml&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;theme = &amp;#34;reveal-hugo&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;markup.goldmark.renderer]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;unsafe = true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;outputFormats.Reveal]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;baseName = &amp;#34;index&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;mediaType = &amp;#34;text/html&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;isHTML = true&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Reveal&lt;/code&gt; part is what lets you output text in slide format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;create-your-slides&#34;&gt;Create your slides&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;code&gt;/content&lt;/code&gt; and create a file there, called &lt;code&gt;_index.md&lt;/code&gt;. The filename is important, as is its location (I learned that the hard way). This file is going to be the first page people see, so it should probably be a list of your presentation slides. For now, put in something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;+++
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;title = &amp;#34;My presentations&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;outputs = [&amp;#34;Reveal&amp;#34;]
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;+++
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Here are my presentation slides!
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;[&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;sample presentation&lt;/span&gt;](&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;/sample&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, create a new folder for your presentation, such as &lt;code&gt;sample&lt;/code&gt;. In &lt;code&gt;/content/sample&lt;/code&gt;, create a file called &lt;code&gt;_index.md&lt;/code&gt;. Again , the filename is also important here (guess how I learned that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This index file is going to be where you actually create your slides. Here&amp;rsquo;s the context of my &lt;code&gt;/content/sample/_index.md&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each slide is separated by &lt;code&gt;---&lt;/code&gt;, just like in Obsidian, which apparently uses the same converter that reveal-hugo does, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js&#34;&gt;reveal.js&lt;/a&gt;. Note that if you want to try out having an image as a background to one of the slides, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to add that to your &lt;code&gt;/sample&lt;/code&gt; folder and change the filename in the slide in this part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;slide background-image&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;lucrezia-carnelos-AsM4T46tqcU-unsplash.jpg&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;generate-your-site&#34;&gt;Generate your site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to generate your site! Wait - didn&amp;rsquo;t we already do that? Sort of that. That was creating the framework for the site, but now you need to get Hugo to convert those Markdown files you&amp;rsquo;ve just created into something publishable. So cd to the root directory &lt;code&gt;slides&lt;/code&gt; and run this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;hugo
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That command should generate a &lt;code&gt;slides/public&lt;/code&gt; folder, where all the publishable code will go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, you can also check your work by starting a local server with &lt;code&gt;hugo server&lt;/code&gt; and navigating to &lt;code&gt;http://localhost:1313&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;push-your-site-to-a-remote-github-repo&#34;&gt;Push your site to a remote GitHub repo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; into your public folder. This is important, as I initially started the repo in &lt;code&gt;slides&lt;/code&gt; and it took me ages to realize that GitHub Pages requires an &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; in the root directory to function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initialize a Git repo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;git init
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stage and commit your changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;git add .
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;git commit -m &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Initial commit&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a repository on your GitHub account called &lt;code&gt;username.github.io&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;username&lt;/code&gt; is your GitHub username. (If you already have a repo called that, you can alternatively push the contents of &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; to a branch called &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt;). The repo name matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Push your changes to your repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;git push -u origin master
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should now have a repository on GitHub called &lt;code&gt;username.github.io&lt;/code&gt;, containing everything in &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;set-up-github-pages&#34;&gt;Set up GitHub Pages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On GitHub, go to the repository settings and scroll down to the GitHub Pages section. Select the right branch (&lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; in most cases) and click Save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;optional-using-a-custom-domain&#34;&gt;(Optional) Using a custom domain&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to use a custom domain, enter it in the repository settings from the previous step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, go to your domain registrar and add a CNAME record pointing &lt;code&gt;www&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;username.github.io&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/about-custom-domains-and-github-pages&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s more information on that&lt;/a&gt; from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can take a few hours for DNS records to propagate, so after you set this up, take a break before you convince yourself you&amp;rsquo;ve set something up wrong. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;check-out-your-new-site&#34;&gt;Check out your new site!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you navigate to your new site, you should first see the contents of &lt;code&gt;slides/content/_index.md&lt;/code&gt;, which has a link to your sample presentation. Clicking on that should &lt;em&gt;reveal&lt;/em&gt; (ha) the slides one by one. You can navigate through them with the arrow keys, and you can also see speaker notes (if you put any in, which I did on the third slide if you copied my sample slides).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;other-issues-i-faced&#34;&gt;Other issues I faced&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran into a few issues during this setup because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was already tracking changes in my Obsidian vault with Git&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I already had a repo called &lt;code&gt;nicolevanderhoeven.github.io&lt;/code&gt;, and I needed to create a branch called &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; to still use GitHub Pages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My Obsidian repo on GitHub is a private one, but I wanted the slides to be public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a similar setup, maybe the following instructions will help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;use-worktrees-not-subtrees-or-submodules&#34;&gt;Use worktrees, not subtrees or submodules&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After attempts to make this setup work with submodules and subtrees, both of which were way too complicated for what I needed, I settled on using worktrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt;. From &lt;code&gt;slides&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;echo &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;public/&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &amp;gt;&amp;gt; .gitignore
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a worktree for &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;, to be tracked on the branch &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;git worktree add public gh-pages
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;After you generate the static code via &lt;code&gt;hugo&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;cd public
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;git add .
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;git commit -m &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Commit message&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;git push origin gh-pages
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;code&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch should contain only the files in &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;github-pages-with-a-private-repo&#34;&gt;GitHub Pages with a private repo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub Pages is free, but if you want to be able to use it with a private repo, &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/troubleshooting-custom-domains-and-github-pages&#34;&gt;you can&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/a&gt;. Sorry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can look into using GitHub Actions to copy &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; from your private repo to a public one, or you could just &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pricing&#34;&gt;spend the $4/month&lt;/a&gt; to remove the restriction. I opted to pay, because I love GitHub anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;presentation-as-code&#34;&gt;Presentation as code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it! I ran into a few snags while I was attempting to implement this, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d document it here in case it helps anyone else. Despite the setbacks, I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth it&amp;ndash; I can now whip up presentations in Markdown within Obsidian and have that published to a site I control for people to look through at their own leisure. This should speed up my presentation creation process considerably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theoretically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only I could stop procrastinating on creating this presentation by setting up a framework for creating presentations&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;meta property=”og:image:height” content=”628″ /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20210206-06-readwise-to-obsidian.png&#34; alt=&#34;Readwise to Obsidian workflow&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;August 10th, 2021: Readwise just released their own Obsidian plugin, &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.readwise.io/article/125-how-does-the-readwise-to-obsidian-export-integration-work&#34;&gt;Readwise Official&lt;/a&gt;, which is available now! I now recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210810-readwise-to-obsidian-redux/&#34;&gt;this method&lt;/a&gt; over the one outlined in this article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m about 9 months into heavily using &lt;a href=&#34;https://roamresearch.com&#34;&gt;Roam Research&lt;/a&gt; as my primary note-taking, task management, capture-everything system, and for the most part, that&amp;rsquo;s gone very well. &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; is another excellent personal knowledge management (PKM) system, though, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been curious about it for almost as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Roam. I&amp;rsquo;ve had it installed for a while, but I never really &lt;em&gt;seriously&lt;/em&gt; attempted to make the switch. Until now. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to use Obsidian as my primary PKM and zettelkasten for the next month, to see if it&amp;rsquo;s something I can switch to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why I&amp;rsquo;m considering switching from Roam to Obsidian is another post, probably one I&amp;rsquo;ll write at the end of this experiment, when my thoughts and opinions are more solidified. For now, I want to address one of the things I struggled with when switching over: Readwise integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/nicole&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt; is an app that&amp;rsquo;s all about importing notes and highlights you&amp;rsquo;ve made from all over the internet and exporting them all into a single format. Readwise supports far more import sources than I use, but here are the ones I&amp;rsquo;ve got hooked up to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instapaper (for highlights and notes on online articles)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amazon Kindle (for highlights on ebooks)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Twitter (for interesting tweets)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(Readwise) Web highlighter (for straight highlights off any webpage)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Airr (for quotes and notes from audio podcasts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readwise collates my activity in all of these input sources and automatically sends them to my Roam Research account. Here&amp;rsquo;s what that looks like when it gets pulled into my Daily Note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20210206-01-readwiseimportsinroam.png&#34; alt=&#34;Tweet, podcast, and book notes pulled into Roam Research via Readwise&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readwise also pulls metadata into Roam, depending on the source. Here&amp;rsquo;s what the page for the book &amp;ldquo;Ready Player Two&amp;rdquo; looks like in Roam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20210206-02-readyplayertwo.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ready Player Two book notes in Roam, imported via Readwise&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Readwise integration is an &lt;em&gt;essential&lt;/em&gt; feature for me in any PKM, because I can take notes wherever I&amp;rsquo;m consuming my content and just have it automagically appear in my notes, tagged and ready for processing. So it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely something I need to have in my Obsidian workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s where things get tricky, because Readwise doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; an Obsidian integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20210206-03-readwise-export-options.png&#34; alt=&#34;Readwise doesn&amp;amp;rsquo;t automatically export to Obsidian&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/export&#34;&gt;Readwise Exports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closest thing is the Markdown export, but that&amp;rsquo;s not automatic. You can manually trigger an export, and then copy those exports over into your Obsidian vault, and thne make sure they&amp;rsquo;re in the right format with the right tags. I knew I was never going to do that, so I found a way to automate it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;readwise2directory&#34;&gt;readwise2directory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered that Readwise has an API, and briefly thought about building my own integration. Happily, I found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nicrivard/readwise2directory&#34;&gt;this Python project on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nicrivard&#34;&gt;nicrivard&lt;/a&gt;, who had already done that! Why rebuild the wheel? His solution already did what I needed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It connects to Readwise via your Readwise access token&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks for new highlights or updated ones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exports the new/updated highlights to a local folder of your choosing (presumably your Obsidian vault)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It even pulls in highlight tags from Readwise, if you&amp;rsquo;ve created any (which I haven&amp;rsquo;t).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/readwise2directory&#34;&gt;forked the project here&lt;/a&gt; to add just a few minor touches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changed date format of imported notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a section to output the import date to a comment block (an &lt;a href=&#34;https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v0-10-12-insider-build/12295&#34;&gt;Obsidian Insider build feature&lt;/a&gt;) rather than YAML frontmatter, so that the date would actually be linked and backlinked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customized tags and filename for my use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sort imports into folders within my Obsidian vault depending on source (&lt;code&gt;Article/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Tweet/&lt;/code&gt;, and so on).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works out pretty well. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of an import from the podcast app &lt;a href=&#34;https://airr.io&#34;&gt;Airr&lt;/a&gt; into Obsidian, in Edit mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20210206-04-airrtoobsidian.png&#34; alt=&#34;readwise2directory import from Airr into Obsidian&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s placed within my &lt;code&gt;Podcast&lt;/code&gt; folder inside my value, is tagged appropriately, and contains links to the source. Switching to Preview mode shows an imported cover photo and even a playable recorder for the part of the podcast that I snipped on Airr:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20210206-05-airrinobsidian_preview.png&#34; alt=&#34;Preview mode of imported Airr quote in Obsidian&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that works out well, except for one thing: firing off the script that does all this is still manual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scheduling-the-script&#34;&gt;Scheduling the script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to schedule a Python script to run at certain intervals. I&amp;rsquo;m on macOS, so I used a built-in utility called &lt;code&gt;cron&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;give-cron-full-system-access&#34;&gt;Give cron full system access&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cron needs to have the right permissions to run scripts on my behalf, so I had to go to System Preferences &amp;gt; Security &amp;amp; Privacy &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Full Disk Access on my laptop and add &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/cron&lt;/code&gt; to the &amp;ldquo;allowed&amp;rdquo; list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;open-crontab&#34;&gt;Open crontab&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, from my terminal, I ran the command &lt;code&gt;env EDITOR=nano crontab -e&lt;/code&gt; to open up the list of cronjobs I had currently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;set-a-schedule&#34;&gt;Set a schedule&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I added a line to crontab for the schedule I wanted to create. This line has to be in the format&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;* * * * * command
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where the five asterisks correspond to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;minute&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;hour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;day of the month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;day of the week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my case, I wanted it to run every hour, so here&amp;rsquo;s what my schedule looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; * * * * cd /Users/nic/git/readwise2directory/ &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.9/bin/python3 /Users/nic/git/readwise2directory/readwise-GET.py &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /Users/nic/git/readwise2directory/readwiseGET.log
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h4 id=&#34;python-issues&#34;&gt;Python issues&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had some trouble getting cron to work until I realized it was because I had multiple versions of Python installed. I ran a &lt;code&gt;which python3&lt;/code&gt; to find the path to the version I wanted to use and added that path to the command. I also had to &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; to the project directory, for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I was troubleshooting, I found it really useful to output to a log so I could see what had gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I added the schedule as in the example above, though, it worked a treat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This solution did require some setup at the beginning, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t need any maintenance once it&amp;rsquo;s going. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with it as it means I can keep taking notes on various places from anywhere, and it&amp;rsquo;ll all be waiting for me in my Obsidian vault whenever I&amp;rsquo;m ready to sit down and process them into my system. Thanks to nicrivard for the repo that made it possible!&lt;/p&gt;
