      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve recently transitioned from Roam Research to Obsidian, you might run into a few issues, even after you&amp;rsquo;ve run the &amp;ldquo;Markdown format importer&amp;rdquo; core plugin. One of the most annoying ones that I ran into was that files uploaded to Roam (images, pdfs, etc.) are automatically uploaded to Google Firebase.
Roam assets are linked to in the Markdown files like this:
![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-471a1.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMyNotes%2FxRFXx7l-ZK.png?alt=media&amp;amp;token=1e03b680-5472-33dc-9b06-a127301af37f) Now, since Roam relies on security by obscurity on this front, the links to your assets will still be accessible in your Obsidian vault, and they&amp;rsquo;ll still render correctly.</description>

      <description>Originally published on the Abstracta blog.
If you have a public-facing web application, the odds are you should probably be thinking about load testing. Any tester can (and should) add load testing to their repertoire.
Functional tests are often carried out with a single user&amp;rsquo;s experience of your application in mind, but what happens when hundreds or thousands of users are on your site at the same time? Load testing helps prepare an application for this eventuality by simulating that situation before the application goes live.</description>

      <description>Note-taking and personal knowledge management get talked about in academic circles, by both students and teachers. But there&amp;rsquo;s not much said about its use outside of the academe.
I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, due to my job description, I may be in a better position than most to take advantage of note-taking in a professional context. My background is in software performance testing. My job for several years has been to make sure that applications are prepared to withstand traffic from many users accessing it, usually by writing code to simulate that traffic before it&amp;rsquo;s released to real users.</description>

      <description>I was working on a presentation for later this month when Marie Drake told me about slides.com. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a Powerpoint replacement (which, let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, needs replacing) in that it lets you create slides and it lets you present from it. It even goes beyond Powerpoint in that it also saves your slides publicly for people to view later.
Before she&amp;rsquo;d mentioned slides.com, I had been planning on creating a presentation on Obsidian, my note-taking tool of choice.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m about 9 months into heavily using Roam Research as my primary note-taking, task management, capture-everything system, and for the most part, that&amp;rsquo;s gone very well. Obsidian is another excellent personal knowledge management (PKM) system, though, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been curious about it for almost as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Roam. I&amp;rsquo;ve had it installed for a while, but I never really seriously attempted to make the switch. Until now.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m starting off the new year by learning something new. I am a big fan of non-traditional education, and Coursera is a platform I&amp;rsquo;ve used a few times before. You may not get courses that qualify as university credit, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found it to be a useful resource for learning. I might be biased (my university degree is in Economics, which I&amp;rsquo;ve never used), but in some ways, I actually prefer a MOOC (that&amp;rsquo;s a Massively Open Online Course) to a typical formal university course for a few reasons:</description>

 I was working on an article yesterday comparing the performance of k6 with JMeter, and I had a chat to Mihail, one of the devs of k6. He mentioned that a large part of why k6 is so performant compared to other tools (particularly Java-based ones) is that it&amp;rsquo;s written in Go. He talked a bit about Goroutines, and when I told him I was a Go noob, he recommended this very excellent video by Kavya Joshi, which explains a bit more about the Go Scheduler and how it manages to achieve performance for Go apps that exceeds the typical 1 Virtual User: 1 kernel thread paradigm that many load testing tools (like JMeter) use.</description>

If you&amp;rsquo;ve talked to me personally for longer than ten minutes in the last year, there&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good chance I&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned Roam Research, or the note-taking and learning methodology called Zettelkasten. Sorrynotsorry. I&amp;rsquo;ve been obsessed since I discovered it.
To say Roam Research is a note-taking device is like saying Bitcoin is currency: yes, it IS that, but also so much more.</description>

      <description>Today was my first day at k6.io! I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve joined as their newest Developer Advocate for Performance Testing. k6 is a company I&amp;rsquo;ve had my eye on for a while, even (or maybe especially) when I was working for a competitor, Tricentis Flood. I always admired k6&amp;rsquo;s stance on open source, their involvement with the developer community, and the slick web app that brings load testing into the hands of many developers and testers.</description>

People often start load testing by creating a script in their favorite load testing tool, but good load testing starts before that. Planning a load test may seem like a tedious exercise, but it is essential to ensuring the success of your testing.
A test plan should answer why, what, who, when, and how the testing will be carried out.
A good test plan, particularly for load testing, includes the following components:</description>

‍API load testing is one of the most popular ways to run a load test because of the number of open source and commercial load testing tools available on the market that support it. Creating a script to hit your application&amp;rsquo;s API endpoints is the traditional approach to load testing, but it&amp;rsquo;s not the only one.
Here are some things to consider when deciding whether or not API load testing is right for your application.</description>

On June 1st, 2020, the National Institute of Health and Environment (RIVM) announced that everyone with certain symptoms could call the hotline 0800-1202 to arrange a free COVID-19 test. The promise: call today, get tested tomorrow, and receive the results the day after that. The reality, though, did not live up to expectations.
The opening day of the hotline was chaotic, and many Dutch people reported connection problems due to a system overload.</description>

Where you run your load test can affect the results that you get as well as your project&amp;rsquo;s bottom line. In general, there are two infrastructure options to consider for load testing your apps: on-premise and cloud. Which type of environment is best for load testing both web or mobile apps?
Differences between on-premise and cloud load testing What is on-premise load testing? On-premise load testing is running your performance or load testing scripts on load generators you physically control.</description>

We first announced our open-source browser-based load testing tool based on Puppeteer, Flood Element, in February 2018. Despite our decision to make it an entirely separate tool from Flood, we&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed using it so much as a team that several of us have written about it:

Working from home during this pandemic and wondering how to start load tests from the office? Today, we&amp;rsquo;re officially introducing Flood Agent, a way to turn your own physical or virtual machines into load generators that you can control from anywhere with an internet connection.
TL;DR:  Installing Flood Agent on a machine lets you start load tests on it remotely from Flood—even if it&amp;rsquo;s within a corporate VPN.</description>

One of our most commonly-asked questions is: &amp;ldquo;What are the best tools for load testing?&amp;rdquo; The answer will depend on a few things: your reason for load testing, the application you want to test, what kind of load testing you want to carry out, your team&amp;rsquo;s experience with scripting, and how many virtual users you want to run.
Note: In this video, I say that traditional load testing tools can&amp;rsquo;t simulate requests that are triggered by interactions on the client-side.</description>

How do you record the traffic from your native mobile app using Apache JMeter? In this video, I explain step-by-step how to begin load testing a native mobile app.
‍   You might want to be doing this because you&amp;rsquo;re load testing a mobile app but either you don&amp;rsquo;t have access to your developers right now so they can&amp;rsquo;t help you with how the requests are made or what the requests are, or maybe you just want to verify what you&amp;rsquo;ve already been told.</description>

Angry customers flocked to the internet when the Robinhood investment brokerage app went down last Monday and part of Tuesday, leaving them unable to trade stocks on a day where Wall Street reported historic gains. Could this have been prevented?
The answer is yes. Applications should always be assessed for risk and tested accordingly. Risk-based load testing helps unearth problems that would otherwise only surface in production.</description>

In the recent RubyConf 2020 held in Melbourne, Australia, Nancy Cai from AirTasker talked about how they built a performance testing framework using Ruby JMeter and Flood. Luckily, we had some pleasantly surprised Flooders in attendance to take notes during this fantastic talk!
AirTasker is a platform allowing the outsourcing of everyday tasks. When discussing the reasons that AirTasker decided they wanted to carry out performance and load testing, Nancy told a fascinating story about an overly successful marketing campaign—a good problem to have, but a problem nonetheless.</description>

What is mobile load testing? What is the difference between load testing web apps and mobile apps? In general, your goal is the same: to improve app performance by systematically exposing your app to the load you expect, whether it&amp;rsquo;s on the web or on a mobile device. However, while the purpose may be the same, there a few extra things to consider when it comes to mobile app performance, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to make some key mistakes.</description>

It’s difficult to be a good load tester if you don’t like data, because a lot of the value of the load testing is in the analysis. Even if you successfully generate load against an application, it’s ineffective without enough data to determine how your application coped with the load. At Flood, we’re passionate about data because we know it drives decisions, so we’re always working to improve how we present data generated by our nodes.</description>

Every good test begins with requirements.
You may think, “But I’m a tester! I’m not a business analyst!”, and I hear you. But as testers, especially on smaller teams or shorter projects, it’s still part of our job to make sure we know what our clients want. Otherwise, how do we know whether we’ve succeeded or failed?
At Flood, I often speak to project teams who ask for help interpreting reports.</description>

In this part, we’ll go over some questions that are commonly asked in technical interviews about the use of the most popular open-source load testing tool, Apache JMeter.
Using JMeter, you record a key business process. Upon playing it back, however, you notice an error on the first page. What could have gone wrong and how would you fix this? While recorders have gone a long way towards making scripting easier, modern security measures like the implementation of viewstates have also made scripting more complicated to record.</description>

In case you missed it, there’s a new performance test tool on the block, and it’s called Flood Element. It’s a scalable browser-based tool that allows you to write scripts in javascript that interact with web pages like a real user.
Using Browser Level Users is a newer approach to load testing that overcomes a lot of the common challenges we hear about traditional methods of testing:</description>

One of the more interesting things to load test is video. You see, traditional load test tools are protocol-based, which means that their approach to load testing video is to capture and simulate the traffic that the browser generates under the covers, sending the same requests to the application. This approach can still be successful&amp;ndash; in fact, one of our favourite clients here at Flood recently used Gatling to simulate 6 million concurrent users streaming video from their application.</description>

It’s always ideal to run performance tests against an environment that’s production-like. That way, you can ensure that your tests aren&amp;rsquo;t being influenced by factors that are not present in production - such as sub-optimal specifications, or the configurations of a test server. So, what does a good performance tester do? They compare their machine specifications and request production-sized boxes to run their tests against. But is that really enough?</description>

Apache seems to be stepping up the frequency of it’s releases, and we’re not complaining. JMeter is an amazing open source load testing tool and the most popular one used at Tricentis Flood by far.
The big question is: Should you upgrade? Are the new features worth the leap?</description>
