      <description>Today was my first day at k6.io! I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve joined as their newest Developer Advocate for Performance Testing. k6 is a company I&amp;rsquo;ve had my eye on for a while, even (or maybe especially) when I was working for a competitor, Tricentis Flood. I always admired k6&amp;rsquo;s stance on open source, their involvement with the developer community, and the slick web app that brings load testing into the hands of many developers and testers.</description>

In this video, Flood co-founder Tim Koopmans and I teamed up at Tricentis User Conference 2020 to talk about the essential ingredients for load testing.

People often start load testing by creating a script in their favorite load testing tool, but good load testing starts before that. Planning a load test may seem like a tedious exercise, but it is essential to ensuring the success of your testing.
A test plan should answer why, what, who, when, and how the testing will be carried out.
A good test plan, particularly for load testing, includes the following components:</description>

      <description>On this episode of Joe Colantonio’s TestGuild performance podcast, I talked about how human factors are often not taken into consideration when designing load tests, which is a mistake that can have serious consequences.

In this video, I discuss how to make your load testing scripts more realistic by including test data. The load testing tool I use is Flood Element, but you can apply these principles to any tool. You&amp;rsquo;ll find a copy of the Element script I used below.

We&amp;rsquo;ve always been a fully distributed team at Flood, but the current world crisis has still changed the way we work. Here are some of the things we&amp;rsquo;re doing to keep self-isolation from being too isolating— and maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll help your team too!
Within the Flood team, flooders-in-training (aka children) have made more surprise appearances in team meetings. Work has been punctuated with grocery runs to buy essentials before they run out.</description>

      <description>Originally published on Medium.
“We’ve done the anywhere part,” Brian Chesky announced a few days ago, “but AirBNB is still, for some, an alternative way of travelling… until today.”
AirBNB Plus is a new tier of service that AirBNB have introduced for homes and hosts that go beyond the Superhost standard.
Here’s what an AirBNB Plus listing means:
