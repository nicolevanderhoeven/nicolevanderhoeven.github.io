      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20231030-ksix-news-0_47/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20231030-ksix-news-0_47/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, my colleagues (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.srperf.com/&#34;&gt;Leandro Melendez&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://testingwithmarie.com&#34;&gt;Marie Cruz&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://javaducky.com&#34;&gt;Paul Balogh&lt;/a&gt;) and I discuss the latest updates in k6 v0.47.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/iUwSgJgJBAI&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve created an official &lt;a href=&#34;https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/19665-k6-prometheus/&#34;&gt;k6 Prometheus Grafana dashboard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/18030-k6-prometheus-native-histograms/&#34;&gt;another dashboard for Prometheus with native histograms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New APIs have been added for Prometheus Remote Write output for k6 (authentication and HTTP headers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve increased the character limit for metric names from 63 to 128, aligned with the OpenTelemetry specification update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;k6 browser tests can be executed in Grafana Cloud by everyone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve improved the cookie API for k6 browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve added support for &lt;code&gt;page.on(&#39;console&#39;)&lt;/code&gt; for k6 browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are now official Docker images that include a Chromium-based browser for running k6 browser tests within CI/CD pipelines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributed tracing is in public preview for Grafana Cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/avitalique/xk6-file&#34;&gt;xk6-file&lt;/a&gt; is a new extension that lets you rename files within your k6 script.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/deejiw/xk6-gcp&#34;&gt;xk6-gcp&lt;/a&gt; is a new extension that adds k6 support for messaging using Google PubSub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/grafana/xk6-dashboard&#34;&gt;xk6-dashboard&lt;/a&gt; is now an official Grafana extension that lets you generate HTML dashboards from k6 test results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/szkiba/k6x&#34;&gt;k6x&lt;/a&gt; is a new utility that automatically detects when you import k6 extensions and builds the custom k6 binary for you so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/grafana/k6-operator&#34;&gt;k6-operator&lt;/a&gt; now has a Helmchart deployment option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Obsius Publish is a new Obsidian plugin that lets you share a note on Obsidian for free. It&amp;rsquo;s best used as a complement to Obsidian Publish in that it particularly shines when wanting to share notes temporarily. Obsius Publish is a third-party community plugin that adds commands to Obsidian to let you push the contents of a note to Obsius and gives you a shareable link to make the note accessible over the internet.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried to use Obsidian properties in YAML frontmatter, you may have noticed some issues. Obsidian v1.4 brings a new UI for properties that may just solve some of those, including the difficulty in keeping frontmatter properties and keys consistent.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lost in all the Obsidian core plugins? Here&amp;rsquo;s a video that goes through every single one of them: which ones I&amp;rsquo;ve left enabled, which ones I&amp;rsquo;ve disabled, and which community plugins I use instead. This &amp;ldquo;Obsidian Tour&amp;rdquo; series is about showing MY personal setup of Obsidian, not the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; one. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that sharing how I use these plugins will help you decide whether or not they could fit in your workflows, too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I show you my favorite method for taking notes on podcasts with Snipd, Readwise, and Obsidian: three tools that work very well together. Snipd is a mobile podcast player app for iOS and Android that integrates with Readwise. With the Readwise Official plugin for Obsidian, that means my highlights and notes from podcasts end up automatically in my Obsidian vault, tagged appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://testingwithmarie.com&#34;&gt;Marie Cruz&lt;/a&gt; and I talk about burnout from a more technical point of view. We discuss how burnout is similar to an overloaded system (and how it isn&amp;rsquo;t), and we draw comparisons on how to make an overloaded system more resilient and recover from burnout.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We usually see productivity as a positive thing, but what happens when productivity gets toxic? According to my friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://polaine.com&#34;&gt;Andy Polaine&lt;/a&gt;, design leadership coach, burnout can occur when you&amp;rsquo;ve been doing more than you used to, struggling with the work, and feeling like you can&amp;rsquo;t say anything to anyone. In this video, Andy shares some tips for setting up boundaries to create mental space and defending your calendar against external pressures.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you monitor behind a firewall? With Grafana Cloud Private Data Connect, you can create a secure tunnel to query data sources, even including those in VPCs on public cloud vendors. Senior Software Engineers Stephanie Hingtgen and Georges Chaudy talk to me about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

I demonstrate some of them, talk about why I didn&amp;rsquo;t keep others, and talk through my use cases for each one. These plugins aren&amp;rsquo;t necessarily the best ones out there for Obsidian - they&amp;rsquo;re just the ones that are useful enough for my use cases to have them installed on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how I structure my Obsidian vault using tags, folders, links, metadata (used in conjunction with Dataview queries), and bookmarks. This is an Obsidian tour of my main vault, and we&amp;rsquo;re starting with organization. As with anything on this channel, don&amp;rsquo;t take what you see here as gospel. I&amp;rsquo;m just sharing my approach in case it sparks ideas for some of you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this talk, I show why I think taking notes for work with Obsidian has not just helped me learn faster but improved my career working in tech as a Developer Advocate and performance engineer. I take notes continuously as a way to keep my skills relevant. This is a rehearsal of a presentation I gave &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20230614-lost-art-of-taking-good-notes&#34;&gt;at EuroSTAR 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How would you go about testing Kubernetes networking? For his initial project with k6, our new Senior Software Engineer, Roberto Santalla, talks to us about how he used k6 to improve end-to-end network throughput and some insights he learned about Kubernetes networking along the way. I also invited my colleague, Leandro Melendez, to help me interview Roberto.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Text Expansion in Obsidian With Espanso</title>

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20230609-text-expansion-in-obsidian-with-espanso/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a few questions asking me how I do text expansion in Obsidian, because there are a lot of text expander plugins out there. The truth, though, is that I don&amp;rsquo;t use any of them. Instead, I use a separate, free, open-source app called Espanso to define text triggers and replace them with certain phrases. One of the best things about Espanso is that it stores all configuration in plain text files.&lt;/p&gt;

I work remotely full-time, and in this trip I have three talks in one month, several meetups with friends and family, and livestreams to do. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I chose to bring with me to remain fully operational while also travelling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For me, using Obsidian is about more than just taking notes&amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s about creating learning exhaust. Learning exhaust is the byproduct of real learning, and thinking of my notes as learning exhaust has helped me shift my focus from taking good notes to learning new things well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many tools for organizing PDFs in Obsidian, but which one is the best? In this video, I go through several options, including DevonThink, Readwise, Skim, and Zotero. For my (non-academic) use case of organizing my TTRPG-related PDFs, I decided on Zotero&amp;ndash; but maybe something else will be better for you!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How does Mike Shea (Sly Flourish) do lazy GM note taking with Notion? Mike shows me how he uses Notion to prep and run games, and I&amp;rsquo;m taking the opportunity to show him some of how I do the same in Obsidian. Mike is the author of several RPG-related books, including the Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master and his latest, The Lazy DM&amp;rsquo;s Companion. Mike has been playing RPGs for almost 40 years and is a forever DM. He also has a YouTube channel where he releases two videos weekly: one about news in the RPG community and one where he preps live for one of his games.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Taking notes on people in Obsidian sounds weird, but I think it just shows how much I care. If I take notes on things that matter, why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t I take notes on people that matter? Here are the templates I use to remember important things about significant people in my life.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know that there is a k6 JavaScript ecosystem on top of the Go extension ecosystem? What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between the two? What does k6 actually support? What types of things can you do with JavaScript? In this k6 Office Hours, Software Engineer and k6 maintainer Mihail Stoykov joins me to talk all about the different options for k6 available through JavaScript libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taking Notes for RPGs in Obsidian with Andy Polaine</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20230331-taking-notes-for-rpgs-in-obsidian-with-andy-polaine/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 31 Mar 2023 14:30:21 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20230331-taking-notes-for-rpgs-in-obsidian-with-andy-polaine/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend, &lt;a href=&#34;https://polaine.com&#34;&gt;Andy Polaine&lt;/a&gt;, joins me to discuss taking notes for RPGs in Obsidian. Andy is the Dungeon Master for one of my weekly games of D&amp;amp;D, and in this livestream, we&amp;rsquo;re comparing our notes (his as a DM, mine as a player) for the same campaign, a homebrew one in the world of Exandria (from Critical Role). We&amp;rsquo;re showing the differences between our styles of note-taking and playing games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8IyaSGI8X8Q&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways&#34;&gt;Key takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andy&amp;rsquo;s DM style is improv-heavy and inspired by the Lazy GM, &lt;a href=&#34;https://slyflourish.com&#34;&gt;Sly Flourish&lt;/a&gt;. His notes reflect that philosophy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andy primarily uses folders for organization due to concerns regarding futureproofness, whereas I use links and Dataview and have no sub-folders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andy has Dice Roller tables for random generation, but he also embeds existing websites as iframes within Obsidian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a situation calls for many moving parts, monsters, or factions that the party might encounter, Andy uses an Adversary Roster to keep track of where everyone is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andy uses Canvas to display multiple statblocks at a time and be able to zoom in individually when necessary. He said he initially had performance issues with this approach, but those seem to be resolved now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a transcript of the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-we-met&#34;&gt;How we met&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Hello, everyone. Welcome to the channel. I&amp;rsquo;m Nicole van der Hoeven. You probably already know me, but today, I&amp;rsquo;m also Scura, the level eight Pallid Elf Twilight Cleric/Stars Druid. And with me today is a someone who should be a familiar face now. I think this is your third time back. Andy Polaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Not sure. Second time on the stream, I think maybe, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Okay, okay. But we already did a TTRPG thing together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: That&amp;rsquo;s right. So it is the third time in the Obsidian DM world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So Andy happens to be my DM, my Dungeon Master for my D&amp;amp;D 5e game. And that actually happened because of that presentation we did on Obsidian, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: It is, yes. We&amp;rsquo;re chatting on the Obsidian channel, the TTRPG channel. And at some point, I kinda said, oh yeah, well actually I need another person. But you probably, &amp;lsquo;cause you had said something like, I play 50 games a week or whatever. And I said, &amp;ldquo;You probably don&amp;rsquo;t need another game.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: It was like four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: And you went, &amp;ldquo;Well actually.&amp;rdquo; So yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah. So you slid into my DMs and you&amp;rsquo;re like, &amp;ldquo;Well, just in case you need a fifth.&amp;rdquo; And I&amp;rsquo;m like, &amp;ldquo;Actually, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a weekday one yet. So maybe, yeah.&amp;rdquo; So let&amp;rsquo;s talk about that, because you definitely knew when you asked me to join your game that I took notes. What was going on inside your head? Were you like, &amp;ldquo;Yeah, I want someone to take notes.&amp;rdquo; Or did you not really know how much I would take notice of everything that happens?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: No, I mean, I wanted another player and I wanted someone who was into the same stuff and I thought you would be interested and a great player and you have been. It&amp;rsquo;s great to have you in the game. I mean, leading up to that, actually, I guess, I had played D&amp;amp;D when I was a kid, teenager, and then I stopped and then COVID happened and like a lot of people, I sort of thought, &amp;ldquo;Oh yeah, D&amp;amp;D that&amp;rsquo;s a thing.&amp;rdquo; And it was actually to talk to my daughter about it and try and persuade her to play. And then the internet happened between when I stopped playing D&amp;amp;D and when I wanted to start again. And so I was looking for ways to note take and have everything. And I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a few different things, including Notion and I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like Notion&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip; The main thing was no offline mode, which was a real big thing for me. But I&amp;rsquo;m also like many people who use Obsidian, I&amp;rsquo;ve been keeping my notes for my work stuff in as plain text markdown for years. And so I thought, &amp;ldquo;Ah, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna switch to that.&amp;rdquo; So very quickly, I did one game in Notion and I started actually the campaign that you&amp;rsquo;re currently play in Notion. I think the first few, maybe five or six sessions, and then I switched to Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Oh, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: With all the pain that exporting out of Notion with like these horrid, long hex or these database codes attached to all the files. I&amp;rsquo;ve still got some of that junk occasionally appears in my auto completes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, I can imagine. I think by that point, I&amp;rsquo;d been using Obsidian for a while, but I had just started to use it a lot for TTRPGs &amp;lsquo;cause you know, I was gonna use it for like serious stuff like work. and that changed very quickly. I know. Hey, do you have dice with you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: I do have dice I do have dice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Let&amp;rsquo;s do rollies again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Okay, alright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I got my-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: You better explain what rollies is for people who may not-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: It&amp;rsquo;s just rolling a d20, seeing which one&amp;rsquo;s higher &amp;lsquo;cause I have a question from Patreon. And the person who gets higher is going to decide whether they answer first or the other person answers first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: All right, okay. All right, you ready?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Okay, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Oh no. Natural one. Okay, you decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Okay, okay. I decide whether, well, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what the question is. So that would-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: No, you gotta decide if you wanna go first or me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Well ladies first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Oh, great. Okay, so the question is for me, what GM are you? And for you, what player am I? Andy is a very empathetic GM. He listens and he listens to not just the stuff from the character but also your stuff. And maybe this is something where we should talk about knife theory &amp;lsquo;cause Andy&amp;rsquo;s particularly good at remembering things that draw you into the story, your character and you. And I think he&amp;rsquo;s mentioned quite a few times that he likes slightly messing with us all, so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yeah. So, okay, so what player are you? Well, you&amp;rsquo;re great. You are actually very empathetic player and you play a cleric, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: That was my thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yeah, yeah. And so, no, what I used to say is that basically, Scura runs around healing everyone way too much from my liking as the DM. But Scura does a lot of, if you like a hit point machine, just of vending machine, like here you go, you have hit points and you have some hit points. And so you&amp;rsquo;re very engaged on that front. You&amp;rsquo;re very engaged in the role play. And thanks to Obsidian, Scura has got like a sort of photographic memory. So you have&amp;hellip; And you, Nicole, use it I think to kind of mess with me as well sometimes too, which is, usually through sending-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: No, I would never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-use-sending-to-mess-with-andy&#34;&gt;How I use Sending to mess with Andy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Should we talk about sendings here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, I could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: I&amp;rsquo;m assuming here that everyone knows about how D&amp;amp;D works and stuff. So I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is true, but you might all be Obsidian people just interested in this. For those of you don&amp;rsquo;t know, there&amp;rsquo;s a spell in D&amp;amp;D. It&amp;rsquo;s called sending where you can send 25 words to someone sort of telepathically over distances. So tell me what you do with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Well, I actually have something to show on that front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Okay. All right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(recorded video plays)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I&amp;rsquo;m gonna play a little clip that I got permission to show. I&amp;rsquo;m going to send to, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what her name is. Sabilis, Sybilis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: I don&amp;rsquo;t who.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: The drow priestess that wanted Wally to come with her to Xhorhas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Oh my God. Let me just check who that might be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TYLER: Great pull. Great pull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: That is like, I gotta choose this, this really random that you haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about for ages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(back to livestream)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So that was a clip from our actual game where I pulled out a particularly unexpected sending. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why it was unexpected really, because my character had been try trying to chase down this thread for the other character. So I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I was unexpected, Andy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Well&amp;hellip;. There&amp;rsquo;s so much that&amp;rsquo;s unexpected. So I would say there was a couple things actually about that group. So I mean, it may be interesting on the note front for people. So if there&amp;rsquo;s an important NPC, and I&amp;rsquo;ll show some stuff in a second, if there&amp;rsquo;s an important NPC, I will usually make a note for them. But sometimes as in this case, there&amp;rsquo;s like a group of NPCs. In this case there was a group of drow, they&amp;rsquo;re called the Kryn in Exandria. We play in the critical role Exandria Wildemount world. There was one of those times where I didn&amp;rsquo;t have much prep time and I thought, &amp;ldquo;Oh, I just need to come up with some names and stuff. And so I think I probably just pulled some stat blocks form somewhere just in case you had a fight with them. But actually, the names, I just had them in a little list and there&amp;rsquo;s a block and like a one line description. I think you might see some in a minute too. And so they didn&amp;rsquo;t have any notes made for them. And so when you said that, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking through my dashboard and stuff and I think I can&amp;rsquo;t think who that is at all. And the name didn&amp;rsquo;t stick with me at all, so yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, you know what&amp;rsquo;s weird is I actually wasn&amp;rsquo;t there. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t there when they met her. I was going off of the recording, this is when I think I briefly came in, I dialed in from the airport. So I had very limited video to go on because not everything was recorded. And so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually sure, that&amp;rsquo;s why I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the name. But I can show you how I look at how I decide who to send to. So I&amp;rsquo;m using the new bookmarks feature. I actually have one for sending, in particular. These are all the sendings. There&amp;rsquo;s a tag now that I do. So like for example, I didn&amp;rsquo;t change any of my notes so I hope nothing comes up. But this is how I do it. So I have the sending tag, I have the name of the person and then what I actually sent. And that&amp;rsquo;s easy because then I can highlight it and I can see, &amp;ldquo;Hey look, it&amp;rsquo;s 25 words, which is the limit of the spell.&amp;rdquo; And then when I go into a particular NPC, I also later put down all of the sendings I&amp;rsquo;ve ever sent to them and their response back. So this particular NPC, I have apparently reluctantly sent him messages a few times. But I also have an agenda page. So I have some sendings planned already and I go down the list. And I also have, this is a Dataview query that it&amp;rsquo;s a Dataview JS query. And it&amp;rsquo;s all like random NPC. So there is an element of randomness &amp;lsquo;cause sometimes, these are the ones that I know I want to send to, but these are the ones that I&amp;rsquo;m like, &amp;ldquo;Huh, I wonder who Rolf is and what they&amp;rsquo;re doing today.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: It&amp;rsquo;s annoying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I have-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: It&amp;rsquo;s in a good way, it&amp;rsquo;s very funny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Annoying in a good way. That&amp;rsquo;s me. I have a follow up list. These are the people that I like to talk to often that I&amp;rsquo;ve sent more than one sending to. They&amp;rsquo;re like important to my character or to the group or to the story. And I&amp;rsquo;m also using Supercharged Links by the way. That&amp;rsquo;s why all of these icons are there. So the rainbow is like a PC and the other one, which is like a vampire actually. It&amp;rsquo;s like an NPC. So that&amp;rsquo;s basically it. I have ideas of whom to send to. And they&amp;rsquo;re also based on the quests and questions that we&amp;rsquo;ve got. &amp;lsquo;Cause these are like, some of them are just for me, for my character and some of them are for the group. I don&amp;rsquo;t know. I find sometimes that I&amp;rsquo;m the one that&amp;rsquo;s like, other people in the group are like, &amp;ldquo;Hey, what are we doing here again?&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m like, &amp;ldquo;Okay, this is what we&amp;rsquo;re doing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Scura would definitely have glasses or something and be the one that goes, the one who&amp;rsquo;s the character who is most likely the brainy, one of the group who actually knows everything&amp;rsquo;s going on and pulls everyone else into line on that front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, I actually rolled a journal for her in her starting items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: That&amp;rsquo;s perfect. So that&amp;rsquo;s handy, A magical journal where you can interlink different pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I know. I actually purposely never play a character with low intelligence because of it. Because I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s realistic. We have a question. Oh, by the way, there&amp;rsquo;s someone, Mariana Bergo, who said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a lovely collision of worlds. I follow Andy&amp;rsquo;s work on service design but had no idea he&amp;rsquo;s a D&amp;amp;D guy as well. That&amp;rsquo;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: I have in mind to do some crossover stuff actually about this, about some of stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from RPGs too and managing teams and design leadership and stuff and vice versa. So we&amp;rsquo;ll see if that emerges. So what&amp;rsquo;s the question?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Courtney Robertson says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does your group share notes? Curious if the group might use GitHub or some other means to sync?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so no. Well, I publish my notes and sometimes, I&amp;rsquo;ll post my notes especially if somebody was away that week or something. I&amp;rsquo;ll publish my notes. There&amp;rsquo;s another person who we got into Obsidian and he doesn&amp;rsquo;t publish it though. He will just often like export to PDF from Obsidian. And Andy of course, can&amp;rsquo;t share his notes with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;andys-dm-style&#34;&gt;Andy&amp;rsquo;s DM style&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yeah, I think a couple of them actually, a couple of others too. So I think three out of the other four use Obsidian and what state their notes are in. So I have to say it&amp;rsquo;s incredibly handy for me. So as the DM, I really do make up quite a lot. I mean, I think people forget&amp;hellip; It maybe just my style. So one of the things you would ask me, what am I like as a DM? I follow the Sly Flourish&amp;rsquo;s Lazy GM format. So I prep kind of&amp;hellip; I think about it a lot. I caught myself this week actually thinking about some stuff like all week. And in fact, the session that we just had on Tuesday, there was a little bit of trolling I did to Nicole&amp;rsquo;s character that I-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: A little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Had been thinking about the joke basically, and the setup of it and just crafting it all week. But then generally, I spend maybe an hour, two hours maybe. And in fact the one we&amp;rsquo;re about to have a look at, the session we&amp;rsquo;ll look at in a second, I spent probably a lot of time. Over a couple of weeks, I probably spent about four hours maybe prepping this, plus the map. But usually, I spend less than that. But then, I did that classic thing where I sometimes I prep very little and I&amp;rsquo;m terribly worried. And literally, so this group is an interesting group in that they&amp;rsquo;re violent pacifists. They&amp;rsquo;ll sort of avoid combat and then chop people in half. Once they get triggered, it goes violent. And they&amp;rsquo;re quite a suspicious group, so quite a suspicious party. So we&amp;rsquo;ve had sessions where it&amp;rsquo;s literally taken like half an hour in real time to decide to go through a doorway or something. And I think this isn&amp;rsquo;t unusual actually in other parties. So sometimes that happens and I think I prep all of this stuff and I think, &amp;ldquo;Oh God, I&amp;rsquo;m not prepped at all.&amp;rdquo; And literally we get through about 20% of it. And sometimes, we blast through it or they desire to do something else. And there of course, I have to improvise an awful lot. Should we have a look at some notes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I take pleasure at that happening. I wanna ask you first, how many notes, yeah, how many notes do you think I have for this campaign?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Oh, I don&amp;rsquo;t know. It&amp;rsquo;s gonna be 1,000. No, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, 800. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how many, like including other stuff or just the campaign itself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Just the campaign. Not including pictures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: 700.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Less actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Oh, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: It is 486 notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: It&amp;rsquo;s still quite a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: It is but it&amp;rsquo;s 133,784 words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Wow. It&amp;rsquo;s telling me I&amp;rsquo;ve got, well, 1,915 files. But actually, the DM notes come up to 321. And here&amp;rsquo;s where all the Obsidian people fall off the 102 folders. So I might want to explain-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Oh God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: -why that is. Oh God, you use folders? You heathen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Heathen!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: So do you wanna have a look?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Do you know bookmarks can- Yeah, yeah. Do you wanna add it or do you want me to do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: No, I&amp;rsquo;ll do it. I&amp;rsquo;ll do the same. Bookmarks can what?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Bookmarks can actually on my version, bookmarks can bookmark a folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-tour-of-andys-dm-vault&#34;&gt;A tour of Andy&amp;rsquo;s DM vault&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: I can do that too. I can do that too. Yeah, it does work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m gonna show people around my vault a little bit. Not too much. And you&amp;rsquo;ll see I&amp;rsquo;ve got the episode title here and it says sanitized &amp;lsquo;cause there there was like two secrets that you&amp;rsquo;re not allowed to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dm-reference-resources&#34;&gt;DM reference resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have a bunch of DM resources here. I have the raw reference here, the SRD plus other stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve added. I have this thing which I don&amp;rsquo;t really use anymore, which is called default tabs. So I used to use it quite a lot where I&amp;rsquo;d pull up some generators and cheat sheet and stuff. I don&amp;rsquo;t really use it anymore. And in fact, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve lost my DM screen, but I&amp;rsquo;ll put it back up there. I have a DM screen, which is set up as a list. I used to have it as a Kanban, but I prefer it in a list &amp;lsquo;cause I can just sneak it in in that left-hand column. So I have two keyboard hotkeys set up, which is to hide the two sides and I use them all the time both in work and also DMing. So this is quite handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the other thing plugin I use a lot is the hover one. So I&amp;rsquo;m really quite often doing this thing where I&amp;rsquo;m just checking something here. And so, that&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;m doing that. So back to this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;random-tables&#34;&gt;Random tables&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have a bunch of random raw tables. I don&amp;rsquo;t use these so much. The one I use a lot is the NPC. So I have a big random roller, which is like, pulls from a lot of stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s got a button at the top and it&amp;rsquo;s pulling from a bunch of lists. I think some of these will break, but it&amp;rsquo;s also got things like sort of encounter some of these encounter roll tables and stuff that I&amp;rsquo;ve got around in my vault. So if I just go, I&amp;rsquo;m going to&amp;hellip; So I re-roll that. And I can quickly find an NPC and a name. Something&amp;rsquo;s a bit weird I think with the name there actually now it&amp;rsquo;s pulling, it should be first name, second name. And they&amp;rsquo;ve got some stuff here and I sometimes re-roll that bit. Always drinking over by under. Sometimes, that&amp;rsquo;s handy. And occasionally, if you&amp;rsquo;re wandering around, you will meet some of this stuff. Probably less so. I sometimes might use it when I&amp;rsquo;m writing bits of an encounter or I might trust, okay, travelers on the road do they meet someone or a roadside encounter. But I actually don&amp;rsquo;t use this as much as I thought I would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I probably use most are things like these things which are iframes. So there&amp;rsquo;s a website called RPG Heroes. I use this all the time. So when you go, &amp;ldquo;So do I see anyone to ask directions?&amp;rdquo; And I&amp;rsquo;m like, &amp;ldquo;Oh yeah.&amp;rdquo; And then I go, &amp;ldquo;Yes, there&amp;rsquo;s a guy with a long beard and a cloak and stuff.&amp;rdquo; &amp;lsquo;Cause I like the visual. And I quite often ignore the rest of it, but sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s quite useful. This one is useful for stat blocks. It generates stat blocks as well. So RPG Tinker is good and there&amp;rsquo;s a bestiary version of it too. And sometimes, use Tetra Cube one, but I mostly use those or I have quick name lists as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in game, that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m doing. All the other stuff is mostly for adventure writing if I&amp;rsquo;m doing stuff. And there&amp;rsquo;s more of that in there. Now I&amp;rsquo;m seeing amount of PDFs and stuff in here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have some charts and tables like price list I use quite often. We&amp;rsquo;ve just had a couple of shopping episodes. I have a price list encyclopedia here and when someone goes, &amp;ldquo;Oh, I wanna go and buy a crossbow.&amp;rdquo; And I&amp;rsquo;m like, &amp;ldquo;Crossbow. Oh yeah, yeah, well that&amp;rsquo;s gonna cost you.&amp;rdquo; Let&amp;rsquo;s just go through hand crossbow, that&amp;rsquo;s 75 gold. So I&amp;rsquo;m not spending ages searching around in stuff for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s most of the stuff I&amp;rsquo;m using in game. And there&amp;rsquo;s obviously sort of monsters and stuff like that. I have them in folders partly because this existed before Obsidian and I like to have my stuff in folders on the desktop. So when I don&amp;rsquo;t have Obsidian handy or maybe one day might use something else whatever, the stuff is organized. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to become so dependent on say on Dataview that I can&amp;rsquo;t use all the stuff in my folders or tags for that matter. I do actually just started tagging stuff on macOS in Finder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dm-notes&#34;&gt;DM notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My actual DM notes are in Wildemounts - Tuesday Wildemount DM notes. I didn&amp;rsquo;t change that &amp;lsquo;cause this is like ripple across so many links. So I&amp;rsquo;ve got a previous sessions note and I have a current one, and I make a folder. And the reason why I have it in folder instead of just a note is &amp;lsquo;cause sometimes, I have sub bits of a plot arc. And particularly, if I&amp;rsquo;m borrowing bits from an existing adventure like a published adventure, I&amp;rsquo;ll have them in here and the bits of that are actually in that session&amp;rsquo;s folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I do it as separate notes because then, what I can do is if we don&amp;rsquo;t get through it all, I can just move the bits that we haven&amp;rsquo;t got through into the next problem. So that&amp;rsquo;s why I do that. So that&amp;rsquo;s my current session always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have a previous session lister. So this is a Dataview query that is doing that. And I can go through an hour, in fact hour, and sometimes I have a few other bits and pieces. I have some scratch stuff so you&amp;rsquo;re not seeing this but these are sort of things I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of that might come up. They end up sort of in there. So I have adventures, I&amp;rsquo;ve got some different quests. I&amp;rsquo;ve got some extra lore stuff in here. I&amp;rsquo;ve got some specific images to this world and items and stuff. And then I have locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;location-dashboard&#34;&gt;Location dashboard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In every location, so we are gonna have a look at a place named Shadycreek Run. Every location has its folder, there&amp;rsquo;s some hooks, plot hooks in there, there are locations in there, there are maps and there are NPCs. And that&amp;rsquo;s how I structure it. And then I usually have a dashboard. So this one here is the Shadycreek dashboard I&amp;rsquo;ve actually gotta open up here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that is a bunch of&amp;hellip; That&amp;rsquo;s a map using the leaflet plugin. I have a bunch of Dataview things that are pulling stuff out that&amp;rsquo;s tagged as locations, NPCs and so forth. And back to my point that I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna become so dependent on Dataview that I can&amp;rsquo;t live without it, that&amp;rsquo;s what the folders are for, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stuff in here is tagged. And so if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have Obsidian, if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have Dataview, I can still go and find all those NPCs and stuff &amp;lsquo;cause they&amp;rsquo;re in that folder and I&amp;rsquo;m not having to hunt around amongst locations and other stuff as well. So that&amp;rsquo;s why I do it. But the dashboard is super handy. It&amp;rsquo;s particularly handy for when they go, &amp;ldquo;I wanna go and go to the blacksmith.&amp;rdquo; And I&amp;rsquo;m like, &amp;ldquo;Hang on a second, I have that table.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: We haven&amp;rsquo;t gone to most of these!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yeah, yeah, we have. So then I&amp;rsquo;m like, &amp;ldquo;Oh yeah, blacksmith. Oh I want to go to a shop.&amp;rdquo; And I think with this one here, so I&amp;rsquo;ll often just gonna pull up there. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why that&amp;rsquo;s looping. It&amp;rsquo;s into like some ridiculous nested thing there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the Jezean Emporium for example, they went there. I pretty much, that&amp;rsquo;s very weird. That&amp;rsquo;s doing that. What have I got down going on there that is making that nest? I think that&amp;rsquo;s a weird artifact. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s this. What this is here, this blank thing, I still haven&amp;rsquo;t come up with an image for the NPC who&amp;rsquo;s here. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure I decided that he was a taxidermist like, on the spot. So you went-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yeah, yeah. And then I decided he was this known taxidermist and I thought it was funny to have this taxidermist that was this little gnome. And he was in the middle of pretty disgustingly actually stuffing a worg and preserving a worg, which was this big creature. So I had this idea, it was like sort of getting inside. And he was-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I thought that was intentional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: No, no. And then as I was doing it I was thinking, &amp;ldquo;Oh, this is quite good because one of the characters, this guy, Ionos Jagentoth, I had him collecting these sort of exotic monsters and stuff and keeping them in a dungeon menagerie. So he&amp;rsquo;s got this dungeon or he had this dungeon, we&amp;rsquo;ll come to that in a minute. That was full of these different creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Cause I was looking through Kobold Press&amp;rsquo;s Tome of Beasts and I thought, &amp;ldquo;Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be really great to have just a whole load of monsters of different kinds in one place in a dungeon or in an area, they&amp;rsquo;re in cages and there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of switches on the walls and the players don&amp;rsquo;t really know what the switches do.&amp;rdquo; And so I had a random roll table for the switches and I was rolling to see what they did. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember if I got you to roll. I think I&amp;rsquo;ve got you to roll. Which what the switch did. So sometimes, it like it opened one cage but there was a couple of switches that opened everything and it would&amp;rsquo;ve probably been-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Oh God we would&amp;rsquo;ve died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: All the creatures come out. And I thought it was really nice and funny. I thought it was funny most of the time, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to think of stuff that was funny idea to have all these different creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they might start fighting each other and stuff as well &amp;lsquo;cause they were creatures that definitely probably would just like feed off of each other and things in the midst of this sort of chaos. Plus you had a fairly major boss character turn up at the same time. So that was the idea behind this. And anyway, so Kimbal Jezean who was the&amp;hellip; And I am pretty sure the source for this by the way, was the very good Exandria Discord. It&amp;rsquo;s a very good community online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Wait a minute, his potion prices are plus 10%, what?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yeah, his prices, well because you are in&amp;ndash; so Shadycreek Run, for those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, is like the Mos Eisley of Wildemount. It is a dodgy sort of outpost outside of the main empire. And so yeah, so there is a premium on the prices. right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had some potions for sale here, which you may or may not have got. Burned down, thanks to Halkin. So one of our players, his character got petrified, he&amp;rsquo;s a wizard and so he rolled another character, which is a barbarian dragonborn. And who followed these sort earth goddess called Melora. Anyway, seeing these stuffed animals, he was incensed and basically paid someone to burn it down. There was a lot of that going on in this particular thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, the main thing that I wanna say about him is that a lot of the stuff about him being a taxidermist and well I just sort of thought, &amp;ldquo;Oh, that&amp;rsquo;d be funny.&amp;rdquo; And then I thought, &amp;ldquo;Oh maybe he&amp;rsquo;s delivering creatures, either live creatures or stuffed versions of it as trophies to the Jagentoths.&amp;rdquo; And I thought that might be a good connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I just came up with his character and his voice, which I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna do right now immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: But that was the best part about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Let&amp;rsquo;s go like this. Oh hang, on a minute. I&amp;rsquo;ve just gotta go and get this slime off of my hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Oh it was perfect. Did you do that just on the spot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: I did do that on the spot, yeah. And I regretted it &amp;lsquo;cause I-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Oh wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: After about five minutes of talking I was like. So that was it. So that&amp;rsquo;s how I then reuse something like that dashboard and the NPCs that are in it &amp;lsquo;cause when Nicole as Scura goes, &amp;ldquo;Oh I&amp;rsquo;m just gonna send sending to this person.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m like, &amp;ldquo;Yeah, who&amp;rsquo;s that again?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;nicoles-note-on-shadycreek-run&#34;&gt;Nicole&amp;rsquo;s note on Shadycreek Run&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I wonder if I should show my Shadycreek dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Well do you wanna show, yeah, maybe let&amp;rsquo;s switch &amp;lsquo;cause there&amp;rsquo;s more I can show you. &amp;lsquo;Cause I&amp;rsquo;d like to show you the Jagentoth compound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Ooh, we&amp;rsquo;re switching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: But you go to yours first and see where you got to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Okay, so this is my note on Shadycreek Run. I also have the Leaflet thing. I think you gave us this. And then the places that we have been to are already marked on there. So when I click on them, it goes to the note. I do also have Dataview queries. These are the locations that aren&amp;rsquo;t shops. I have factions because a big part of Shadycreek Run is that it&amp;rsquo;s ruled by these families. And so I have notes on each of them like, here&amp;rsquo;s the Jagentoth family. People that they&amp;rsquo;ve killed, businesses. I even have like a little diagram of their family tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: It&amp;rsquo;s more than I have, I can tell you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I think I asked you and you&amp;rsquo;re like, &amp;ldquo;Uh, yeah, Reese. Reese is his name.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yeah, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I thought. No, I think some of them are in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Oh, okay. And then also I have Dataview query that lists everybody that&amp;rsquo;s on there. So every NPC I put their family if it&amp;rsquo;s relevant as a faction as well. And then some of these have skulls, that&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;cause we killed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yeah, quite a lot of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, so here are all my NPCs from Shadycreek Run. Some of them are dead. And I have a little description of them. I mean, sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s really like, Sybastien: doesn&amp;rsquo;t like Wally. Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s very vague. And then here are the shops in Shadycreek, &amp;lsquo;cause that&amp;rsquo;s like a separate thing. Kimbal said I might get calming tea here which I did actually. And then I have sessions. So I think there was one point when we were like, &amp;ldquo;Oh, when was that? What session was it that we were last here?&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m like, &amp;ldquo;Oh it was on 37 or whatever.&amp;rdquo; But my numbering is different from Andy&amp;rsquo;s by the way, just because I came in like after 17 sessions. So I&amp;rsquo;m 17 sessions behind. So that&amp;rsquo;s my Shadycreek Run one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Next week with session 83. So it&amp;rsquo;s been going for two years. Actually just around this time, I think April, it was the session zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah. So should we go into a particular session that you-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Let&amp;rsquo;s do that. Yeah, let&amp;rsquo;s do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Okay, well&amp;hellip; Let me ask first though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-for-the-session-andy-chose-to-show&#34;&gt;Background for the session Andy chose to show&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Why did you really choose this session and why was it to troll me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Okay. So I did not deliberately troll you. So there was a significant event with an NPC from Scura&amp;rsquo;s backstory in this episode. And I actually thought it had happened in the previous episode, session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Still not convinced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: And I chose this one because it was one that I had prepped sort of quite a lot for it. It&amp;rsquo;s got some, I think some maybe some interesting prep stuff in it in terms of the way I went about structuring it. And it was interesting on because there was some extra bits that I did, which I then have probably then carried on and we&amp;rsquo;ll probably continue in the future because it was quite complex. There were a lot of NPCs. So the session is, they go to this place they&amp;rsquo;re called Jagentoths, they go to their compound, it&amp;rsquo;s this house set in the forest surrounded by the perimeter fence. And there&amp;rsquo;s an NPC called, sorry, there&amp;rsquo;s an NPC called Floyd. And I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why I&amp;rsquo;m laughing in a second. His name&amp;rsquo;s Floyd Hemsworth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one of the other characters-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Crownsguard Douche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: -Milla, had a dalliance with him. Crownsguard Douche, as you&amp;rsquo;ve christened him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there was reverse damseling. So basically they had to go and rescue him. He had been captured by this boss guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so you&amp;rsquo;ve got the NPCs, a lot of NPCs cause there&amp;rsquo;s guards and there&amp;rsquo;s all the other characters that have been, they&amp;rsquo;re also in it. And this is a thing we talked about in session zero. There are some slaves in this that these are nasty people. So I really wanted to go, this is one of those things where I&amp;rsquo;m not going to have slavery, like the characters have the main party, have slaves, for fun and stuff. But these are bad people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So bad that in fact the party decided to burn their whole place down and kill them all and rescue the slaves. So you&amp;rsquo;ve got the slaves, you&amp;rsquo;ve got the family, you&amp;rsquo;ve got all the guards, plus you&amp;rsquo;ve got this basement, this dungeon menagerie in the basement with all these different creatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there&amp;rsquo;s quite a lot going on and it could have gone in a lot of different directions for me as a DM. So that&amp;rsquo;s one of the reasons why I prepped it. Fairly often, I don&amp;rsquo;t do that much prep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fairly often, I&amp;rsquo;ve got maybe three or four scenes, very bare bones sketched out what&amp;rsquo;s gonna happen. If there&amp;rsquo;s any encounter stuff, I&amp;rsquo;ll have a sort of encounter set up and that&amp;rsquo;s about it. And then kind of, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I think I&amp;rsquo;m fairly good at winging it. I think quite often, I said I feel so unprepared and you guys don&amp;rsquo;t think so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was entertaining about this one is I was really prepared and I expected you to do a sort of heist thing and sneak in to the house, rescue, explore the house. I had all these kind of, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna show you. Let me put up my thing and I&amp;rsquo;ll show you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;andys-session-prep&#34;&gt;Andy&amp;rsquo;s session prep&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: So in the house. Here&amp;rsquo;s the session, So the session starts with, I have just have a reminder calendar links back to the Wildemount, I can never remember the names of the week and stuff. So we do a little bit of a thing. There&amp;rsquo;s an eclipse coming up. I don&amp;rsquo;t use this that much, but it just reminds me to, in fact, this is an old Owlbear link. I don&amp;rsquo;t even use that anymore. I use Owlbear-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Actually Andy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: The new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I remember in the first session &amp;lsquo;cause I went back to the first session we played, that played with you and you weren&amp;rsquo;t using calendars, no one had asked about the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: No, that&amp;rsquo;s right. That&amp;rsquo;s one of the things that now, we do have a calendar actually. So now we have the Fantasy Calendar plugin. Thank you, Jeremy. And as you can see, our game moves pretty slowly. There&amp;rsquo;s like five sessions in the space that have happened in the game day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I think we started in Quen&amp;rsquo;pillar though, didn&amp;rsquo;t we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yeah, I think you did. But I don&amp;rsquo;t remember. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I started adding to the calendar until more recently. So in this, I&amp;rsquo;ve made myself a little note to remind about the X or fast forward cards session zero thing. Because of the slavery thing and because one of the guys is the main guy, the main bad is a torturer. I wanted to just remind people if this is something they don&amp;rsquo;t want, they can skip. So then there&amp;rsquo;s a recap and then I have a few DM notes. So these are basically things I mustn&amp;rsquo;t forget to open or I know that I&amp;rsquo;m going to wanna go back and have a look at. I usually list all the NPCs out and this is all done manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Who is Phespo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yeah, who&amp;rsquo;s Phespo? That&amp;rsquo;s a very good point. Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s the Medusa. You didn&amp;rsquo;t know? Did you not know her name? Her name is Phespo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: So there was a character, there was a Medusa that they faced a couple of sessions before this. And so that&amp;rsquo;s why she&amp;rsquo;s there. Just in case I have to go back and remember some of that. And then the rescue&amp;rsquo;s on. So there&amp;rsquo;s the Jagentoth. I called them Jagentoth, it&amp;rsquo;s probably Jagentoth but I live in Germany and for me the Js&amp;ndash; Jagen is to hunt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, it should be Jagentoth, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: And so I&amp;rsquo;ve got these two people, I&amp;rsquo;ve got one note here. That&amp;rsquo;s the scene basically. They&amp;rsquo;re gonna dine around 8 PM. So that&amp;rsquo;s what I had in mind. They&amp;rsquo;re in the dining room at this point in time. You didn&amp;rsquo;t know this, did you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: No, I very nearly poisoned them. I had the midnight tears, ugh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yeah, let me go to the compound because in the compound, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve got a map or have I? Haven&amp;rsquo;t got a map wherever I put it. I haven&amp;rsquo;t got a map. Somewhere, I&amp;rsquo;ve got a map. So what I&amp;rsquo;ve done here on the left-hand side, you can see I&amp;rsquo;ve broken out all of the rooms in the compound. So I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;d got&amp;hellip; I thought I&amp;rsquo;ve got.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Wow, this is a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: This is a lot, yeah. And so I had built this room, I built this mansion in Dungeon Alchemist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Dungeon Alchemist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: And what&amp;rsquo;s it called? What&amp;rsquo;d you say? It&amp;rsquo;s called Dungeon Alchemist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Dungeon Alchemist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yeah, yeah. And I&amp;rsquo;d furnished it all and all of these rooms have some thought behind it. There&amp;rsquo;s a little tree and there&amp;rsquo;s a kitchen here. And here is-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: We didn&amp;rsquo;t see it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: No you didn&amp;rsquo;t. So here is the bedroom, the bedroom has a door to this study. The study has a secret passage, a secret bookshelf door into this secret study with a safe. And then here at the end of this corridor is a secret passageway down into the dungeon. And over here is the slave hut. This is a secret passageway down into the dungeon too. And this was the guardhouse, which you never got to see inside. Because&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: &amp;lsquo;Cause we just burned it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Because you decided to burn the place down. So they-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: We used an immovable rod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yeah, yeah. So they used an invisible rod to block the guardhouse door. They put sort of casks of gunpowder, which they had got illegally elsewhere. You blew up the latrine was the first thing. And then you basically ended up setting fire to the house. So that was quite an interesting thing for me in the sense that, okay, so all that stuff I prepared, they&amp;rsquo;re not gonna see &amp;lsquo;cause they just burnt it down. And all those secrets and all that loot and things like that, that were quite important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Oh no. There was loot??&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: They&amp;rsquo;re gonna see. There&amp;rsquo;s loads of secrets and stuff in there that I had to relocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Oh no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: So then what happened was quite an interesting mechanic for me though, &amp;lsquo;cause they had actually started that in the previous session. I then thought, &amp;ldquo;Okay, what would be going on?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all the guards are obviously some people are trying to put out the fires. A lot of people are gonna trying to be rescuing stuff from the house. So what was happening is that all these people are kind of pulling stuff out of the house and they&amp;rsquo;re putting onto the lawn and things like that. It&amp;rsquo;s kind like people do when there&amp;rsquo;s a bushfire or something trying to rescue the stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But meanwhile down in the dungeon menagerie. Let me open that. What you guys ended up doing was I had, so there were these&amp;hellip; For reasons I won&amp;rsquo;t go into, all the slaves were tieflings. And there was one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had some stuff in here, which is my sort of read aloud thing. Oh, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve got a read aloud callout here and I use that so I can just flip that up. And then what I do is I use embed, so transcludes. So I have all the different bits here and then I can transclude them. That&amp;rsquo;s why I find this quite useful to split them into separate notes. Because then I can adjust the structure and things of what I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be doing in that session. &amp;lsquo;Cause you spent like two or three sessions around this compound. And so I can adjust it, I can embed a note in the scene like I did here and I go, &amp;ldquo;Okay, so the slave house so this is gonna be this thing.&amp;rdquo; And then the dungeon menagerie and then I&amp;rsquo;ve got some stuff around here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have the dungeon menagerie. I&amp;rsquo;ve got Ionos and Ilbane, who was the big bad in this. I pulled a stat block from LevelUp, actually, 5e. Because it was more interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Is this just an image?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: This is just an image. Yeah, I think I&amp;rsquo;ve just clipped a stat block. Out of LevelUp. And sometimes, you use the statblocks plugin and sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s just easier to grab an image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, I get that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yeah. And in this one for the dungeon menagerie, I actually like an idiot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Ooh, ooh, looking at all the secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: It wasn&amp;rsquo;t like an- And there&amp;rsquo;s a secrets and clues things at the end. And I think you know all of these but you know all of these. So I have secrets and clues. So when they found this stuff I go, &amp;ldquo;Okay, right. They found that.&amp;rdquo; These will been reset I think because I can&amp;rsquo;t remember why. Probably made a new sanitized version of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then I have the encounter. So this is using the encounter plugin. So when this is going on, it fires up the encounter there and I work it that way. But the dungeon menagerie was a real issue &amp;lsquo;cause I thought, &amp;ldquo;Oh my god. And there&amp;rsquo;s so many people in this place, how am I gonna manage it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had for the first time ever did an adversary roster. So if anyone knows the Alexandrian, Justin Alexander, he recommends this. It was quite an old school D&amp;amp;D thing to do. And the adversary roster looks like this. It&amp;rsquo;s just a little markdown table, it&amp;rsquo;s got links to some people. And it was just so I can remember, these are all the different people around in the house. And I have an idea of where they are, but they can move around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Did you plan that one of them had a birthday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: So I had this idea. I wanted the guards. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want the guards to dominate everything that you were gonna be fighting multiple guards for ages. And you&amp;rsquo;d gone there, you&amp;rsquo;d scoped it out during the day and then you&amp;rsquo;d gone there in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I thought would it be fun for the guards to be in the guard house getting drunk and being loud. And then, I think in the moment, I thought you hear that one of them&amp;rsquo;s singing &amp;ldquo;Happy Birthday.&amp;rdquo; And it was particularly poetic because that one then came out and got axed, I think by Halkin. It&amp;rsquo;s like, &amp;ldquo;You just killed the guy whose birthday it was.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I quite like messing with them that way. I remember there was one thug and you found a note. I think, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember if you were playing for this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Many, many ways you like to mess with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: So they killed two random thugs who were guarding a place. And then of course, when they searched the bodies, I had a thing where one of them had a note in their pocket from his estranged wife saying, &amp;ldquo;Please come home. Your daughter misses you. Please give up this way of life&amp;rdquo; and stuff. And they&amp;rsquo;re all like, &amp;ldquo;Oh no, we just killed this henchman, but they had a life and stuff.&amp;rdquo; So I apologize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: How cruel is that? What a sadistic, okay, I change my answer. You&amp;rsquo;re a sadistic DM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: My job is to mess with you as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, adversary roster and then I had an encounter table. So using the encounter plugin such as separate, it&amp;rsquo;s in a separate thing as well, a separate transclude, there&amp;rsquo;s an encounter table so that depending on where you went, I could fire up a, a different set of encounters. So if you were gonna fight the house guards and the captain, I can fire up that one and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this was the dungeon menagerie. So I just had this set up like all the creatures are in here and then I would just skip them in the initiative if depending on who was there. You would&amp;rsquo;ve probably struggled if they&amp;rsquo;d all escaped in one go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as it happened, you set fire to the house and missed out quite a lot of, all that prep, all these bedrooms and everything that I created, you guys just completely missed out &amp;lsquo;cause they turned to ash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: There was an ettercap?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yeah, there was an ettercap in the dungeon menagerie. So we play, we use Owlbear Rodeo. So this was loaded into our Owlbear Rodeo and yeah, there was the one that was the ether cap was, there was one cage you might remember that was full of spiderwebs and cobwebs. That was the&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: And then I guess the last thing you were, Floyd&amp;hellip; So the joke was that this Domovoi was Floyd. Ah, so Floyd, he was just a Crownsguard. He was just a guard on a gate. And I thought it would be funny if there was like a really good looking guy and a young doofus who was as a comedic pair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then I said, &amp;ldquo;Oh, this guy&amp;rsquo;s, his name&amp;rsquo;s&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; I thought of Pink Floyd or something, his name&amp;rsquo;s Floyd. And when you ask him directions and that&amp;rsquo;s how it started. And then I said, &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s really good looking. He looks like Chris Hemsworth.&amp;rdquo; And so that&amp;rsquo;s how he became Floyd Hemsworth. And then-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Oh, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: You asked him to come with you. Yeah, the party asked him to come with you. He started flirting with one of the characters who then was flirting, well, she was flirting with him. And then he had all sorts of thoughts about, he became, then I had to build a whole backstory and family and stuff and connections for him. But it was one of the examples of a randomly invented NPC became actually quite important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So anyway, the way the setup was he was in here and the Domovoi had made him invisible but had made himself look like Floyd and was in here. So the idea was that I was gonna lure a character into the cage, get the cage closed, there was gonna be a little cage fight inside here except what happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happened, Scura? Tell us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I foiled your plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Milla. It was Milla that foiled the plans actually. Two of you, both of you, between the two of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I cast the see invisibility, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: So you cast see invisibility and Milla cast Detect Thoughts. And so basically between the two of them, they could work out who was in which cage. So that didn&amp;rsquo;t work. Anyway. So that was my setup for all of that. That&amp;rsquo;s probably as much as I need to carry on going on about, it&amp;rsquo;s been quite a long time, but it was quite complex. And then got foiled by the players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nicoles-session-notes&#34;&gt;Nicole&amp;rsquo;s session notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Good. I can show you mine for the same one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Okay. And if anyone has any questions, please fire away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Okay, so this is the same session. I always like to have like a Midjourney thing that I do just so that in the worldview, in the world note, it&amp;rsquo;s just nice to have cards and each session has like an image of what it looks like. Sometimes it&amp;rsquo;s not quite right, but it&amp;rsquo;s enough to remind me of the session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And oh, that&amp;rsquo;s our video of it actually happening. Oh, so we have a player-only chat where we scheme against Andy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And plan to mess with him almost as much as he plans to mess with us. So there were, at the time, Tyler, who plays Wally, he was away. So sometimes, I put things like instructions for Wally and he had this weapon. He told me when to use it and what the abilities were. And then I like to use these little call outs sometimes to mark what I know and what I don&amp;rsquo;t know or what other players don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I put things in comments so that if somebody goes into my Obsidian published notes, one of the other players, they won&amp;rsquo;t immediately see some things there. So it&amp;rsquo;s the same thing, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here I cast &lt;em&gt;see invisibility&lt;/em&gt; as we were going down into the dungeon. And then I also use Initiative Tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, I&amp;rsquo;m a healer. So part of the reason I love being a healer is that I always love keeping track of where everyone is. So this is what it looks like. I happen to have taken a screenshot of the end of this session. So this is what it looks like. I have everyone&amp;rsquo;s HP, I&amp;rsquo;m going through this using the initiative tracker and I have these custom statuses. So I track things like, if our barbarian has used reckless this round, then I know that he&amp;rsquo;s gonna need a little bit more help &amp;lsquo;cause he is probably gonna get hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if I have temporary hit points that I&amp;rsquo;m giving to people, I would track that here as well. Even things like if people have reacted or not, &amp;lsquo;cause that affects whether my party can leave the threat range. And what I noticed though, you use the initiative tracker, but you don&amp;rsquo;t use the log, do you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yes, sometimes. I do turn it on and off. I do use the log but once I, something crashed or something and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember everyone&amp;rsquo;s, the initiative order. What I don&amp;rsquo;t do is I don&amp;rsquo;t really log everyone&amp;rsquo;s hit points. I let you guys decide. I let you keep track of your character. Obviously, I&amp;rsquo;m keeping track of your opponents, but I&amp;rsquo;m not keeping track of your hit points. Obviously, I&amp;rsquo;m seeing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: That&amp;rsquo;s fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: We still have our character sheets on D&amp;amp;D Beyond, so I&amp;rsquo;m usually checking where you&amp;rsquo;re at on D&amp;amp;D Beyond in the phone app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, so I do that mainly in Obsidian because I need to know who needs healing and I always turn the log on, and this log is like an optional thing for Initiative Tracker, which is the same one that Andy uses. So I have a bunch of them here. There&amp;rsquo;s a separate Folder for log and those are the combats. And then I embed that combat into the session note so that way, it gets updated here. And then while I&amp;rsquo;m going through the rounds, I also just type in some explanation because otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s just things like, &amp;ldquo;Grom took three damage.&amp;rdquo; And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t say, Oh that was because of Divine Smite. So I also track it along the way. And it&amp;rsquo;s just also handy I think if Andy, your initiative tracker stuffs up or something or you lose it, I can say like, &amp;ldquo;No, we&amp;rsquo;re in round three&amp;rdquo; or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yeah, it is super handy. I think one of this is one of the differences between being the DM and being a player also is that as a DM, I&amp;rsquo;m just flat out like in a combat thing, but there&amp;rsquo;s like lots of creatures and people going on. I&amp;rsquo;m flat out concentrating on like everything. Whereas there&amp;rsquo;s a player, you&amp;rsquo;ve got the space between your turn and the next time it comes round to-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: We&amp;rsquo;re much more immersed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yeah, yeah. Well, you are much more immersed, but also you have time. You have time to write notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: I barely write any notes when I&amp;rsquo;m DMing by the way. I probably should. I know loads of people who also don&amp;rsquo;t, I occasionally will write some at the end of the session if like, &amp;ldquo;Oh, I must remember that that&amp;rsquo;s happened.&amp;rdquo; I like Scura gave her two daggers to one of the NPCs, so I wrote that down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Everything. I gave everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: I forget everything. I&amp;rsquo;m very reliant on note-taking players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, so mine was basically the combat after that. And here, I&amp;rsquo;m tracking whether somebody has used my Guiding Bolt advantage on attacks and things like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And at the time, I was also playing two players because one of the other, two characters, because one of the other players was gone. So this is like where I put the next moves for both of them. And then at the end, I had a little note to tell him because I don&amp;rsquo;t have access to his character sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I was thinking that maybe I could also show how I create a new session because this is the world page and I have this nice little add new session button and when I click it, look, everything&amp;rsquo;s filled in for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I haven&amp;rsquo;t processed the last one yet, The Leaky Cucumber. But it creates- It creates the session already. So yeah, I use funny titles as well. So this is where it is at the end of the session, I would put like a summary here so that when I generate the next one that&amp;rsquo;s pulled in, so this is the recap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So often, I do the recap. Sometimes I try to get one of the other players to do it, to encourage them as well. But it&amp;rsquo;s just nice to have everything filled in. And this is also pulling in the date. I set today&amp;rsquo;s date on Fantasy Calendar so that it always chooses today&amp;rsquo;s date. My character is a Twilight Cleric and a Stars Druid, so moons matter. So I do have that as well. Let&amp;rsquo;s just show, oh, by the way, our party&amp;rsquo;s name is Temporary White Circle, and now you didn&amp;rsquo;t notice, Andy. Do you see there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Oh yeah, I see the logo. Yeah, yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;ve got on here, TWC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah. So there, you can also see the moons, Catha and Ruidus. Isn&amp;rsquo;t that cool?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: So you are way more organized in terms of the automation than I am. I generally start by duplicating the previous session&amp;rsquo;s note and because of the stuff in there, there&amp;rsquo;s some secrets and clues still that they haven&amp;rsquo;t discovered and I sort of delete stuff out and then go back in. So my metadata is all manually done. I should probably try and automate some of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, I can just give it to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yeah, but then all the rest of the stuff doesn&amp;rsquo;t work and I just don&amp;rsquo;t have the inclination to go back through every session note though and add it all back in, so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Octavian Datcu says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Nicole, how do you color tags without any tags surrounding it?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what you mean exactly. Let me share my screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: It could be the theme. Is it the?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: You mean, does Octavian mean like the italics and stuff? Because yeah, this is the Anuppuccin theme where you can have the text decorations a different color. So that&amp;rsquo;s handy. For example, if I just put something here, it&amp;rsquo;s automatically green because it&amp;rsquo;s italic. And then this one would be automatically red &amp;lsquo;cause it&amp;rsquo;s bold. I love Anuppuccin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-has-me-taking-notes-changed-the-way-andy-gms&#34;&gt;How has me taking notes changed the way Andy GMs?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Andy. Do you think that it&amp;rsquo;s changed anything about the way that you GM that we take notes, and I take notes, so much?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: I don&amp;rsquo;t know because this was the first big campaign. I&amp;rsquo;d played some small stuff with my family. But it&amp;rsquo;s the first big campaign that I&amp;rsquo;ve done since I was a kid. And so, I guess you came in, I mean, couple of the other players did take notes, but probably, you take obviously more extreme notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What has it changed? I don&amp;rsquo;t think it changes much. I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s just really useful for me. &amp;lsquo;Cause I know that I&amp;rsquo;ve like, &amp;ldquo;Oh God, I didn&amp;rsquo;t make a note of what happened here or who&amp;rsquo;s got what,&amp;rdquo; and things like that especially when you&amp;rsquo;re dividing up loot and things like that. And I know that one of you has made a note, so I&amp;rsquo;ll often ask for your notes or go and have a look at them and that&amp;rsquo;s pretty useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s probably, I think, we&amp;rsquo;ve joking about the sending stuff before. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what it&amp;rsquo;s like for you as a player. I mean, I get the feeling that it sort of makes the world a bit more alive because NPCs, they&amp;rsquo;re not just like, &amp;ldquo;Oh yeah, we spoke to that person and we recorded that one and then we moved on and we&amp;rsquo;ve forgotten all about them.&amp;rdquo; It means that they sort of come back into the world a bit and I think that maybe makes the world feel more alive maybe to you as players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, I mean part of it is me just wanting to mess with you, but also some of these things are actually for a greater purpose. Most of them are not completely random. I am actually trying to do a background check or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yeah, I am very engaged in the world. And there have been a few times where I would&amp;rsquo;ve gone further if I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I was taking up too much time already. I would&amp;rsquo;ve, like, engaged with an NPC a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;taking-notes-on-other-pcs&#34;&gt;Taking notes on other PCs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I don&amp;rsquo;t know, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll also show my notes on the PCs. So this is one of them. Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that they won&amp;rsquo;t watch till this part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is the one for Milla, there&amp;rsquo;s a picture of her, there&amp;rsquo;s a backstory that I&amp;rsquo;ve pieced together from things that she&amp;rsquo;s told me in the game. I do something called an OGAS framework. Occupation, goal, attitudes, stake. So I&amp;rsquo;m just&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of what her goals are because I think my character is very supportive and she wants her fellow party to achieve their goals. So I have to know them first. So I take notes on everybody. So I also have ideals, bonds, and flaws, not the actual ones that she has. So I don&amp;rsquo;t see that, but just, I&amp;rsquo;m guessing. I&amp;rsquo;m guessing based on what she said. And then I also have a section for knives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy, can you explain knife theory?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Oh, we didn&amp;rsquo;t talk about that, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So knife theory is the thing, and there&amp;rsquo;s a Reddit post. So if you Google like Reddit knife theory D&amp;amp;D or something, you&amp;rsquo;ll find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So knife theory is this idea that what you do when you create a player, when you create a character as a player, you give a bunch of knives in there that the DM can use basically to stab you with later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is, there are some things like, I did this thing and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to escape from it or so I have this adversary or I have this ally, or I have this particular weakness, or I have this thing in my past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the more knives there are, the more useful it is for me. The more I can as a DM and the more I can integrate you into the world or integrate the story with their backstories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a lot of stuff comes up fairly randomly as I talked about Floyd Hemsworth. And he is, like I said, he&amp;rsquo;s just a random NPC. And then it forced me, if I go here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Actually, for this session, the dungeon menagerie one, I put all the stat blocks on a canvas. And it was really crawling on the day of the session, so I stopped using it, but it would now actually be quite useful. So I could just quickly grab the stat block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here&amp;rsquo;s Floyd. I found a picture of Chris Hemsworth, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what you know, what this is from here. He is dressed up and he looked a bit like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Well, so he really is just a basic guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Yeah, well he&amp;rsquo;s a captain now. Well, he&amp;rsquo;s more than the captain now anyway. And super handsome Crownsguard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Super handsome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: And then there&amp;rsquo;s a backstory for him. I came up with a kind of, his father&amp;rsquo;s a general and all this stuff. And they ended up being quite a scene with me talking to myself, like him talking to his father, NPC to NPC about it. And so it was quite of, I was able to connect him to a couple of the other characters&amp;rsquo; backstories in interesting ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one of the characters, Wally, I thought, well, like I said, Wally&amp;rsquo;s character is actually, his father&amp;rsquo;s also in the military. So I thought, &amp;ldquo;Oh, this would be interesting that they know each other and stuff.&amp;rdquo; You have to be a little bit careful because you can also end up with a thing like of too many coincidences. But it helps and I&amp;rsquo;d really like the knife thing. And then, occasionally, there are actual player things that I know like things that I then just use to mess with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, I like that stuff. But I also keep notes on knives for the other players and that&amp;rsquo;s what I like&amp;ndash; my character likes to do Zone of Truth, which is basically just us telling&amp;ndash; me, me asking questions to the group-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: It&amp;rsquo;s spin the bottle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: -to the characters. Pretty much, yeah. And those questions come from some knives that I&amp;rsquo;ve identified, like things that they react to in a positive or negative way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I also actually have a section where. So here, the knives are things that the tiefling likes and doesn&amp;rsquo;t like. And then I always have a section of how I can help them for every PC. What are the things that my character, Scura, could do. And then I have this section, which is all of the questions that I ask in Zone of Truth. I also have stuff for playing the tiefling in case she&amp;rsquo;s away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: The tiefling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, I have them. Yeah, I guess she&amp;rsquo;s not THE tiefling anymore, but yeah. They&amp;rsquo;re my notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: I sometimes&amp;ndash; I have a cheat sheet. I found a cheat sheet for Scura actually from a session &amp;lsquo;cause I think that was the one where you were away, you were like getting on a plane or something, so I had a little cheat sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah. Well we should probably end this &amp;lsquo;cause we&amp;rsquo;re over time. There&amp;rsquo;s so much that I would&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to ask you, but probably for my own edification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: You can ask one more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll ask you offline. Okay. What should I ask? Oh, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Roll dice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;taking-notes-on-the-players&#34;&gt;Taking notes on the players&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Okay, okay, I know. Because the kind of GMing that you do, it is very specific to us as the players. I don&amp;rsquo;t know, at least that&amp;rsquo;s what I feel. It&amp;rsquo;s our characters and it&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;ve given you in our backstory as knives. But the more that you know us, the more that you also know our knives as players. So do you take notes on us as well as our characters? Do you just remember that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Only up here. Yeah, I don&amp;rsquo;t write notes really about you as people. No, no, not as players. Some things come up during the week or something and I&amp;rsquo;ll think of something I thought that would be funny to mess with the player. I can do this to their character to mess with the player and I do that, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have notes. I mean, I do have notes from session zero about you and stuff like that. And that&amp;rsquo;s mostly around so I can remember what you said you did and didn&amp;rsquo;t want and things like that. But otherwise no. I don&amp;rsquo;t take notes. Not like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Wow. You just have space in your mind for all sorts of devious things then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Well, lots of improv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, no, it&amp;rsquo;s really well done. It means a lot to me to have a safe space to play a game and to like truly try out things that I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t do in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: That&amp;rsquo;s good. I&amp;rsquo;m glad that it feels that way. That&amp;rsquo;s the aim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: All right, let&amp;rsquo;s close this so that I can ask you the real questions afterwards. Thanks for coming on to the channel again for the second time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Thanks for having me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Maybe we&amp;rsquo;ll have you on for a third. You&amp;rsquo;re always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Okay. Take care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Thank you, everyone for listening and I&amp;rsquo;ll see you next week. Bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANDY: Bye.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How we got into tech (Adobo &amp; Avocados #01)</title>

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20230329-ana01-how-we-got-into-tech/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://testingwithmarie.com&#34;&gt;Marie Cruz&lt;/a&gt; and I have been wanting to talk about a few topics related to diversity in tech, and over the few years we&amp;rsquo;ve known each other, we&amp;rsquo;ve only added to that list. We finally decided to take a leap and start a new YouTube channel/video podcast just so we have a space to have those discussions. Here&amp;rsquo;s the first one, where we talk about how we got into tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/25Ba4Z694Gw&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a transcript of our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-adobo--avocados&#34;&gt;Why &amp;ldquo;Adobo &amp;amp; Avocados&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: All right, we&amp;rsquo;re live. So, hey everyone, my name is Marie Cruz and with me I have my colleague today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Nicole van der Hoeven, I&amp;rsquo;m her colleague. And I&amp;rsquo;m a little sick, but I&amp;rsquo;m here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: So we, today we&amp;rsquo;re actually gonna be doing the first ever recording for the Adobo and Avocados podcast. So we thought about this name and initially like Nicole and I wanted to, you know, ever since before we wanted to launch a podcast where we can talk about, you know, our experiences working in tech and all other things. And then we thought about the name Adobo and Avocado. So you know, to anyone who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know, so we&amp;rsquo;re both from the Philippines, and Adobo is the national dish of the Philippines. So that&amp;rsquo;s why we thought we&amp;rsquo;ll add the name of Adobo in our podcast title. Avocados, &amp;lsquo;cause we&amp;rsquo;re both Developer Advocates. But yeah, I think, why don&amp;rsquo;t we discuss like, why was it called avocados in the first place? Do you have any idea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, well, we don&amp;rsquo;t really know for sure. So I thought that it was something to do with the language of it. Like, you know, an advocate is usually like a, could be like a lawyer in common non-tech senses. And the translation for that is abogado in Spanish or Tagalog actually,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Even in Tagalog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: our native language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So it&amp;rsquo;s like kind of similar to avocado. I don&amp;rsquo;t know, that&amp;rsquo;s kind of what I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s actually an interesting thought. Like, &amp;lsquo;cause the abogado does sound very, you know, similar to avocado, but I actually read this one article where I think their project manager had a hard time saying Developer Advocate, they ended up saying developer avocado. So who knows what the origin is. But yeah, I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great, you know, you know, term in terms of like, you know, the whole play, like playful, you know, meaning behind the word Developer Advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-we-got-into-tech&#34;&gt;How we got into tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: So yeah, I guess first things first, like you know, who we are? Like, why are we doing this podcast? How, you know, we got into tech? So we&amp;rsquo;ll talk first about, I guess a bit of some introductions about ourselves. So Nicole, why don&amp;rsquo;t you start, like how did you get started? You know, what&amp;rsquo;s been your, I guess, background so far? Did you have a traditional, you know, computer science background or did you do like a different, I guess course back when you were still studying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nicoles-background&#34;&gt;Nicole&amp;rsquo;s background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I did not have a traditional background. I grew up in the Philippines. I moved away when I was 18. And I don&amp;rsquo;t know what your experience was, Marie, but mine was that in the Philippines there are still, I think we do a pretty good job at being equal between genders, but I think there&amp;rsquo;s still gender roles. And when I was growing up, I really loved both the maths and sciences and like literature and languages, but I was very heavily pushed towards the humanities, &amp;lsquo;cause that&amp;rsquo;s what girls do. Girls don&amp;rsquo;t go into tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And so I really struggled at uni and in college. I shifted majors six times. I had no idea what I wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And I went through, and that was over two countries. I went to the US to study as well. None of them was computer science because my brother was a developer. And I don&amp;rsquo;t know, he&amp;rsquo;s a little too introverted for me. And I just had this idea that, if I go into computer science, I have to be a developer, and if I&amp;rsquo;m a developer, I won&amp;rsquo;t talk to anyone. I&amp;rsquo;m just going to be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: with a machine. Like I had that in mind, which now I know is completely wrong,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: but that&amp;rsquo;s why I never went into it. So finally my parents were just like, we don&amp;rsquo;t care what you finish,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: we don&amp;rsquo;t care if it&amp;rsquo;s basket weaving, just pick a major and finish it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And that was economics,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: which I have never used in a job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And then so-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: That&amp;rsquo;s really interesting. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And then I, how did I get into IT? I was applying for different economics related ones, and then I met my now husband and he,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Hi Rob.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: he was a test manager. Yeah, hi Rob! He was a test manager and I said, well what&amp;rsquo;s a test manager? And then he told me about the world of testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand it at first, but I wanted to know more. And then I thought the way that he described it sounded so interesting, like the idea that,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: that there is a job, there is a person whose job it is to be the one using applications or products first. And then trying to see what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with it for the purposes of improving it. I just, I really loved that idea and it was another branch of tech that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So I started to, I did an ISTQB certification just to like have something&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: No background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: &amp;lsquo;cause I didn&amp;rsquo;t have any background. Yeah. And I started job hunting, and somehow managed to land a performance testing job under someone who became my mentor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;maries-background&#34;&gt;Marie&amp;rsquo;s background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Hmm, nice. Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s really relatable because like similar with myself, I fall into tech accidentally. Like it was never my intention, you know, okay, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna study computer science, although I did actually have a computer science degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Oh, wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: But the story, the story behind that, I don&amp;rsquo;t share it too much to other people &amp;lsquo;cause I think the story behind it is a bit funny. But my first experience with tech is actually updating my MySpace profile. Do you remember MySpace?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yes so, before you can customize your profile with a bunch of HTML, CSS codes and like I think before I was just trying to, you know, create something even though it didn&amp;rsquo;t look very accessible. I remember I had lots of animations, just lots of like&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: striking fonts, background music, and it was just something that I was doing for fun. I did a mass communications course back home in the Philippines. So I was majoring in digital media. And then I had to go back here in the UK. So I was working first for about two years before I decided to go back to uni. And during that time when I was looking at, you know, courses catalog, &amp;lsquo;cause I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really sure what to pick. So I saw a course which basically has three different things. So it&amp;rsquo;s computer science with business management and financial accounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I thought,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Oh wow, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: I was like thinking in my head I think that sounds like a really cool name for a course, so I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go for it. So to me I just found the name like very interesting. And it means that-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So when did you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: move out of the Philippines?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: So I, so we went back 2008. So I was in the UK since 2004. Actually no, we went back 2006, and then I went back in the UK 2008. So 2006 I enrolled, you know, to study mass communications. I didn&amp;rsquo;t finish the course &amp;lsquo;cause I had to go back in the UK after two years because of like visa, like status. And then when I got back, I just put that into a pause, you know, did some work experience. So I was working as an office assistant for about two years and then my friend and I just decided, okay, I think we should go back to uni. So I actually applied as a mature student &amp;lsquo;cause I didn&amp;rsquo;t, you know, had any like actual qualifications &amp;lsquo;cause I never graduated from my degree in the Philippines. I never finished high school as well, &amp;lsquo;cause I kept going back and forth between the UK and the Philippines. So the last time I actually graduated was during middle school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Oh, wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: but applying as a mature student, they just looked at my, you know, work credentials, like my work attitude. And I submitted some of my grades like back, you know, when I was still in the Philippines &amp;lsquo;cause like my first two years I had some, you know, grades from like the different subjects that I was doing. But yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s how I got into tech. I just found the name like really interesting and I thought before I could mix and match it with business and accounting. So even if the computer science bit didn&amp;rsquo;t work out, like I can still maybe utilize some of the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned on the business side and on the accounting side. And then, when I was about to look for graduate jobs, I got approached by a testing consultancy company. I didn&amp;rsquo;t, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t aware that there&amp;rsquo;s a graduate job for, you know, just doing testing &amp;lsquo;cause most of the graduate jobs that, you know, we were being offered is, you know, how to, you know, do like development, or like database like management roles. So initially I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really sure if I wanted to do the developer route. Like I enjoyed the coding, I was doing the coding bit, but like back then I wasn&amp;rsquo;t like fully 100% sure that it was the right path for me. So I found out that, yeah you can have a career in testing. Again this is all accidental &amp;lsquo;cause if that testing company didn&amp;rsquo;t approach me, I would&amp;rsquo;ve probably looked at like other roles. So it was like really great to hear that, yeah, there&amp;rsquo;s like a graduate jobs for just doing testing. And yeah, we were doing the ISTQB as well. So we were doing some training. And yeah, the rest is history. It&amp;rsquo;s funny because I didn&amp;rsquo;t intend to continue on a developer route, but then now I work as a Developer Advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-did-we-become-developer-advocates-without-being-developers&#34;&gt;How did we become Developer Advocates without being developers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, maybe we should talk about that a bit &amp;lsquo;cause I also don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself as a developer even though I can code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Mm-hmm. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And yet somehow we&amp;rsquo;re both Developer Advocates. How did that happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah. It&amp;rsquo;s like there&amp;rsquo;s some sort of, I guess, interesting link between software testing and developer advocacy. I don&amp;rsquo;t know like if it&amp;rsquo;s the same for you, but like with me, I really enjoy the teaching part, the learning and public part as well. And when I was doing my role as a software tester, I felt that I was doing the advocacy, but maybe, you know, not really in a way that it&amp;rsquo;s very out there. So I was, you know, helping my colleagues, I was talking about tools that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned, you know, with them, I was showing them how to use it. And then while I was working as well, like I started doing the learning in public on the side. So I started with my personal blog and then getting involved, you know, with meetups to talk about, you know, the different tools that I&amp;rsquo;ve learned. So I guess for me, like being a software tester also, you know, encouraged me to, I guess be a Developer Advocate &amp;lsquo;cause I was just telling people what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing as a software tester. I&amp;rsquo;ve been telling them what different tools I&amp;rsquo;ve been using, you know, different concepts that I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning as well on like a day-to-day. So is that the same for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: For me it was more because I was a consultant,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: which means I was going on different projects all the time. And when you&amp;rsquo;re really new in an industry, I think it&amp;rsquo;s really exciting and you&amp;rsquo;re learning a lot. And certainly every project has like its own framework and different languages and different people, which is interesting for a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: But I don&amp;rsquo;t know, after several years of it, I started to feel like, people are actually asking the same questions. You know, there&amp;rsquo;s always, there&amp;rsquo;s some things that I always had to explain. You know, I always had to, for example, fight against the fact that performance testing is often seen as just something where you run the test, okay, you check the box, you&amp;rsquo;ve done performance testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Uh-huh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: There&amp;rsquo;s always a certain amount of education where I&amp;rsquo;m like, no, it&amp;rsquo;s not just about checking the box, it can actually provide real value, here&amp;rsquo;s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And I just found myself repeating a lot of the same things. And so I actually started to create videos also because load testing results are kind of difficult to explain sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And I would create this like test summary report that lots of people don&amp;rsquo;t read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And so, as kind of an alternative way to explain things, I started creating video summaries to go along with it. And then I just thought, well maybe I can, &amp;lsquo;cause I can&amp;rsquo;t publish those, because it&amp;rsquo;s very specific to that company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: But then I, I thought maybe I can pull out, I can abstract away some things and then publish those videos where I&amp;rsquo;m not talking about a specific project. And I guess that&amp;rsquo;s kind of how it started. I started, I put it into text first, because that&amp;rsquo;s just easier than video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And then eventually found myself into video anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So I guess for me, I got into Developer Advocacy because I was tired of, I was trying to automate a part of my life, the explanation part where I kept having to say the same things and I just wanted to be like, hey, read this blog post where I explain why you need think time in a much more coherent and considerate way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So that&amp;rsquo;s, that&amp;rsquo;s how it naturally happened. I think you and I are the same in that regard that we were already doing it before we got the title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah. I totally relate to that. Like, especially when you said that like, we&amp;rsquo;re just trying to solve the same problems. I started, you know, my blogging journey just trying to communicate like, you know, questions that people have been asking me on a day-to-day basis. And rather than just, you know, speaking to individual people and repeating the same things like again and again, like just put everything into a post or like you said like a video, and then just share that, you know, like to the public, &amp;lsquo;cause you&amp;rsquo;re not only gonna be able to help like one person but you know, maybe if someone else stumbled upon your blog or your video, then like, you might help them as well. I think like one of the, like, one of the best reward that I experienced when doing this like learning in public and you know, sharing more content out there is if you just get a message from someone or like a comment and then they say that, oh, like, I&amp;rsquo;ve been stuck with the same issue, I found your blog post or your video and it really helped me. And just that feeling that you know, you&amp;rsquo;ve helped someone is like a really great feeling. &amp;lsquo;Cause at first I wanted the blog as well just so that I can have something that I can look back to in case I, you know, forget like what I&amp;rsquo;ve done on a previous project. Like I can document it on a blog post, but then like now it&amp;rsquo;s also helping like other people who are experiencing the same like issues at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, I definitely see that. At first I was doing these things for myself because you know, you don&amp;rsquo;t really know that you know a subject until you can teach it to some degree. And I really believe that. And I, for me there were so many things &amp;lsquo;cause as a consultant, you have to switch tools very quickly, you have to switch languages, you have to be a polyglot on a lot of different levels and it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to keep all that in your mind. So after every project I tried to like, distill my learnings from it, so that I,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: future me would come back to that framework, or tool, or whatever, and not be starting from zero. But yeah,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: the kind of other people finding it was an unexpected boon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah. So let&amp;rsquo;s just move on a bit. So we&amp;rsquo;ve talked about, you know, how we transition from software testing to developer advocacy. But I guess in terms of like the process, like did you apply to a lot of, you know, companies? Was developer advocacy something that, you know, you were aware of already, or like you just found a job description and then you&amp;rsquo;re like, oh, this is what I do already. Okay, let me apply to that job. So what&amp;rsquo;s been like the process for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So I was, this is only, this is my first job as an actual, like the first job where I have Developer Advocate in my title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: My previous job was with a, well at the time it was a startup, it was Flood.io, which is now acquired by Tricentis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And when I joined, I think I was like, I think the fifth person that they hired in the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Oh, wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So it was very small. And it was, I really love that environment because you can do a lot of things, you can wear multiple hats. And that&amp;rsquo;s really where it started. On a typical day, I might be answering questions in support, or presenting at a conference or ducking into a sales call or like,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: there were so many things that I could do. I was like part of the rotation for things going down basically, for things exploding. And I had to learn a lot about infrastructure as well to be competent in that role. And I started doing a lot of advocacy type things, mainly from a support perspective&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: because I got the same questions there as well. And I wanted to be able to focus on the crunchier topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And you can&amp;rsquo;t do that unless you address some of the more basic or common questions. And then my manager at the time told me about Developer Advocacy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: and my immediate response was, but I&amp;rsquo;m not a developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: He said that that&amp;rsquo;s just the name for the whole industry that I think you would be really good at and that you&amp;rsquo;re already doing. And with his encouragement, this is Tim Koopmans, the one of the co-founders of Flood, with his encouragement, strong encouragement by the way, things like, he said, oh, I&amp;rsquo;ve got this conference in Moscow that I&amp;rsquo;m speaking at. Do you wanna come watch me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And I said yes. And he backed out so I had to do it, things like that. Because of things like that that he did, I started to understand what developer advocacy is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: and when it was, when I felt the time to change directions, I specifically looked at k6 actually. I didn&amp;rsquo;t apply to any other jobs because I was pretty happy where I was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: But I really loved k6. I had already not used it in a project, but I&amp;rsquo;d already, I knew what the tool was and I used it, I tested it a bit. I love the site, I love the principles behind it. And I saw that they had a Developer Advocate role. So,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: It just kind of happened. How about you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Well the first time I heard about the term was from you, when you said that, hey we&amp;rsquo;ve got this role for, you know like, you know like, we&amp;rsquo;ve got a Developer Advocate role for one of the tools that, you know, we&amp;rsquo;re gonna launch. Like, you&amp;rsquo;ll be like the great fit. So I didn&amp;rsquo;t really send any CV. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I sent any CV or like, yeah, I think, you just like, &amp;lsquo;cause we just connected already like via this Automation Guild conference. So like we were already connected via Twitter. And I think this is where like one of the benefits of like learning in public really came into play, &amp;lsquo;cause I was just, you know, publishing constantly. I was, you know, talking at various meetups and conferences already. But I was just doing all of this like as part of my, you know, side projects. Like it wasn&amp;rsquo;t part of my day-to-day role on my previous job. So when you explain to me what a Developer Advocate is, I&amp;rsquo;m like, oh yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing that on the side. So that was my first actual, you know, experience of like hearing what a Developer Advocate, you know, does on a day-to-day. &amp;lsquo;Cause I had the same perception that I&amp;rsquo;m not a developer, how can I be a Developer Advocate? But I think because as like as part of our day-to-day jobs, like even if we&amp;rsquo;re not writing application code, we&amp;rsquo;re still writing, you know, test scripts. we&amp;rsquo;re creating test automation frameworks. So I think that&amp;rsquo;s really helped as well transitioning into this role. But yeah, like I never sent any CV. I just remembered like we were talking a lot like back and forth and then I met up with, you know, a bunch of our colleagues now. And yeah, the rest is like history again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, I think that there are just some people that when you meet them, you click or you don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And when that click happens, I&amp;rsquo;m just like, okay, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna write her name down. I think I told you about it like for two years,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah, I just joined-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: we were talking, and I was like, hey, this could happen&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, I don&amp;rsquo;t know when. I think you&amp;rsquo;d be perfect for it. And you&amp;rsquo;re like, okay,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: but it&amp;rsquo;s kind of early to be telling me, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I was like, Yeah, yeah, but let&amp;rsquo;s just keep in touch. You know, and it worked out. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it actually did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah. And now we&amp;rsquo;re, doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: We didn&amp;rsquo;t actually-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah, go on Nicole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: We haven&amp;rsquo;t actually defined what a Developer Advocate is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-a-developer-advocate&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s a Developer Advocate?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah, I guess like we can both, you know, share what our, you know, view is of a Developer Advocate. So to me when it comes to developers, I guess trying out, you know, new tools or learning about new things, they feel most comfortable talking to someone who&amp;rsquo;s actually used, you know, the product, or you know, the tool that they want to use. So, we are, you know, that person. So we&amp;rsquo;re helping developers, we&amp;rsquo;re helping testers when it comes to, I guess learning about best recommended practices, learning about different tools. So we&amp;rsquo;re kind of like a bridge between the community and like the company that we work for. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of misconception that people think that we&amp;rsquo;re salespeople but we&amp;rsquo;re actually not, like it&amp;rsquo;s a completely different, you know, role. We are focused more on the community side, helping them grow, helping them, you know, I guess in some ways, like be some sort of champions as well, so they can also promote like, you know, the different tools, the different practices that we have been communicating to them. But yeah, what about you? Is that like sort of the same concept?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, I agree with everything you said, especially about being a bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Because as a Developer Advocate you&amp;rsquo;re not quite a developer, that&amp;rsquo;s not our primary responsibility,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: but we&amp;rsquo;re also not like marketers or sales people. Although there&amp;rsquo;s an overlap there in both. I kind of think of it as anti-marketing. So a marketer is going to be talking about something that they themselves have never used, are not the target user for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And might not know much about in terms of the technical details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: A Developer Advocate is someone who actually is the target user. So for those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, Marie and I work at Grafana Labs specifically on k6, which is a performance testing tool. But we have both used k6, we have both been testers and still are. And so there are things that we can suggest. Part of it is advocating internally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: We advocate for testers everywhere to the product team so that we say, like these are the features that we would be looking for as testers. Like we would say it this way or we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really use that feature, we want this other one. But another part of it is advocating externally. So this is the part that people think of as marketing, but I think of it as anti-marketing, because we&amp;rsquo;re not going out there and saying, hey, you should use this product that we&amp;rsquo;ve never used before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Instead, we build cool things and demonstrate cool things that we have done, not some other developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Like we do our demos,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And then when people ask us, then we say, oh yeah, we use k6. So I don&amp;rsquo;t know, marketing definitely has its place, but for me I am so addicted to that authenticity and genuineness that comes from just talking about a tool that you actually love, which is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: what k6 is for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah. I really like that because for me, an important part of, you know, this advocacy is, like communicating something that I truly believe in. Like I&amp;rsquo;m not going to advocate for, you know, a tool that I haven&amp;rsquo;t used. Like I would just feel like, you know, I&amp;rsquo;m a fraud if I do that. So if I know that, you know, there are situations where a certain tool or a certain practice, you know, would work better, then I would advocate for, you know, that as well. So it&amp;rsquo;s not just about, you know, for example, like at the moment we can&amp;rsquo;t do k6 for accessibility and I&amp;rsquo;m an accessibility advocate as well. So I would go and, you know, recommend like other tools and practices based on what like I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced, based on what I&amp;rsquo;ve done. And I think, like for me, that&amp;rsquo;s one of the biggest like advantage, &amp;lsquo;cause yeah, if I&amp;rsquo;ve been put on the spot and say, hey, you should talk about this to then promote it to other people, that would just totally go against my, like one of my beliefs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I think I also really appreciate that this position lets us shine a light on people like us who maybe,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: who don&amp;rsquo;t look like the average person in tech. I know it&amp;rsquo;s still, I&amp;rsquo;ve been lucky to work with teams of mainly men that haven&amp;rsquo;t treated me any differently because I&amp;rsquo;m a woman, but there is still like a sense of being Other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah And I guess that-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And being in a position of advocacy means that we&amp;rsquo;re, we&amp;rsquo;re also able to appeal to other women who maybe didn&amp;rsquo;t, who didn&amp;rsquo;t have as good an experience as we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-can-you-expect-from-adobo--avocados&#34;&gt;What can you expect from Adobo &amp;amp; Avocados?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah. And I guess that really leads to this next question. And you know, people who will watch this in the future might also ask like, what are the expectations like for this podcast? Like why are we doing this? So do you want to maybe start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Why ARE we doing this Marie?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah. Oh, yeah. So do you wanna start like from your side, like what are the expectations that you know, that we can, yeah, share to people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Sure. I think that you and I both do a lot of technical advocacy. We, you know, do demos, we write scripts, and we tell people how to do things in tech, very technical things. But, I think that there&amp;rsquo;s a whole other side of tech that doesn&amp;rsquo;t get talked about and that&amp;rsquo;s like, things like interpersonal dynamics or cultural differences. You and I are both Europeans that have to work in, in our situation, predominantly American space, and we&amp;rsquo;re also Asian. So balancing the two, you know, we are on different sides of the spectrum on that. Just also the general stress that comes with tech. It is not easy, not just as a Developer Advocate, but just to be in tech to keep up with changing trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I feel like there are so many emotional aspects and psychological aspects that don&amp;rsquo;t get talked about that I would really like to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Then also, I kind of alluded to it. I would like to make it a little bit more open, an open discussion for particularly underrepresented people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: like ourselves. We identify with several minority groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And maybe help them along a bit by telling them things that we had to find out the hard way early on in our career. How about you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah. Yeah, I agree with all of those. And I guess it&amp;rsquo;s also to just have a safe space, you know, for everyone just to share their experiences in tech. Like you said, there&amp;rsquo;s this whole other side of tech that we don&amp;rsquo;t talk about that maybe other women are also uncomfortable to talk about, you know, with like, I guess other colleagues, especially if it&amp;rsquo;s just predominantly male. So we want to, you know, have a safe space for them, share, you know, I guess from their side, like their unique experiences as well. And maybe like we can all have, I mean maybe we also have those shared experiences that we don&amp;rsquo;t talk about, but then when someone says, oh yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ve experienced that too. So it&amp;rsquo;s just really finding, you know, shared experiences that we can all relate to. And like you said, just helping them, you know, or empower them to, I guess move forward in terms of like the next stage in their career. Like, you know, share what&amp;rsquo;s worked for us, share what hasn&amp;rsquo;t worked for us. &amp;lsquo;cause I think it&amp;rsquo;s all about like being authentic as well and not just talking about the good things, but we could also talk about the bad and the negative things as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see where we go from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I think we have a lot of ideas about where we&amp;rsquo;re going to take this and I hope people will come along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Yeah. So, yep. I guess this is it for the first episode. We are just, you know, extremely excited to do this on a regular basis. So we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about different, you know, topics in every episode. And we might, you know, have like really awesome, like guests as well in future episodes. So yeah, I guess just stay tuned and yeah, look out for Adobo and Avocados.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARIE: Thanks everyone. See you next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Bye-bye.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taking Notes for Research with Bianca Pereira</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20230327-taking-notes-for-research/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2023 08:56:48 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20230327-taking-notes-for-research/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bianca Pereira joins me to talk about taking notes for academic research as well as general knowledge creation. Bianca is a researcher, a software developer, a feminist by ideal, and an educator by passion, and she comes with a lot of experience in working with PKM (Personal Knowledge Management) and Tools for Thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vbl1nP4H9Yk&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the transcript of our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introductions&#34;&gt;Introductions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Hey, everyone, I&amp;rsquo;m Nicole van der Hoeven, and on this channel, I like to talk about tech, travel and taking notes. My guest today ticks off a few of these boxes. Please welcome Bianca Pereira. (Portuguese) Good afternoon, Bianca, how are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: (Portuguese) Good afternoon, Nicole, I&amp;rsquo;m doing well. (English) Thanks a lot for inviting. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited for our chat today. I really enjoyed chatting with you, and I want to see whoever is here with us today. So if I like to invite, if anyone wants to participate in our chat, maybe can just send us a message down there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, leave a comment with questions that you want to ask Bianca or me, or both of us. But Bianca, (Portuguese) Could you introduce yourself, in English? (English) I practiced that so I needed to say it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Oh, okay. That&amp;rsquo;s really good. Yeah, well, my name is Bianca Pereira. I&amp;rsquo;m a researcher and a knowledge management coach as well. So my focus, when you think about taking notes, managing papers, managing the literature, the source is really like, how can we do personal knowledge management for the purpose of research? So how can we create notes so that we can write research-driven outputs later on? Research-driven outputs can be like papers or they can be an essay or a blog post can be anything that is based on research. So it&amp;rsquo;s really like how can we do the whole process of personal knowledge management for the specific purpose of research? So that&amp;rsquo;s what I work on now. And I keep doing my own research as well in computer science, as we talked before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Rodrigo said, &amp;ldquo;Good Portuguese.&amp;rdquo; (Portuguese) Thank you, Rodrigo. (English) I&amp;rsquo;m trying. I moved to Portugal. But maybe we should explain that connection, why I am randomly speaking to you in Portuguese. You&amp;rsquo;re from Brazil, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m from Brazil, from Rio de Janeiro. And I learned that Nicole, you&amp;rsquo;re speaking Portuguese because you&amp;rsquo;re also living in Portugal, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, of course, I have to learn that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;research-isnt-just-for-academics&#34;&gt;Research isn&amp;rsquo;t just for academics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I thought it was interesting when we were talking about this stream and I said, &amp;ldquo;I wanted to call it taking notes for academic research.&amp;rdquo; And you said, &amp;ldquo;Oh, well, it&amp;rsquo;s not just academic research.&amp;rdquo; You said that you wanted it to be broader, just research in general and also knowledge creation. Can you talk a bit more about the distinction between the two? &amp;lsquo;Cause when I think research, I automatically jump to academic research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yes. Yeah, many people, they&amp;rsquo;re like, &amp;ldquo;Oh, okay. Let&amp;rsquo;s write academic research.&amp;rdquo; I&amp;rsquo;m like, &amp;ldquo;No, please, no.&amp;rdquo; Because at least like from my perspective, I think research, it&amp;rsquo;s not just inside of academia. Everyone not only can do research, but many people do research in their jobs. Even like when you are going to create content, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for me, researcher is more than someone who went through a PhD or went through like formal academic research, but they&amp;rsquo;re all people who are using critical thinking for the purpose of creating new knowledge. For example, someone is in a company, the company is facing a problem and they need to solve a problem, which may be very specific to their company. So they need to do some research. They need to use some tools that we use for doing research to solve the problem to come up with innovation to solve something inside of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for me, from my perspective, that person is a researcher, even when it&amp;rsquo;s not an academic researcher, for example. So that&amp;rsquo;s why I like to think about research as the process of knowledge creation when you&amp;rsquo;re using critical thinking for that. So for me, I think like anyone and everyone could become a researcher or is already a researcher, even when they don&amp;rsquo;t call themselves researchers. So that&amp;rsquo;s why I was like, &amp;ldquo;Oh, let&amp;rsquo;s try to not&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Don&amp;rsquo;t say, &amp;ldquo;Oh, only who is in academia is a researcher, only who went through a PhD is a researcher.&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t think that&amp;rsquo;s the case. I think everyone can use the research for their work, sorry, in their daily lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: That&amp;rsquo;s really cool. By that definition, I think I would classify as a researcher and I had never really thought of myself as one. It&amp;rsquo;s very meta, but I&amp;rsquo;m taking notes on this while we&amp;rsquo;re talking. And you said that one of the things that differentiates, I&amp;rsquo;m paraphrasing here. One of the things that differentiates research from like other forms of note taking is critical thinking. Do you also think that there is a sort of rigor that is applied? Like maybe when people think research, it means that you&amp;rsquo;re collating things from a lot of different sources? Or do you think that that is necessary for research?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: I think, well, it depends on what you mean by rigor. If you&amp;rsquo;ve been on rigor, like, &amp;ldquo;Oh, more like in the academic sense, you need to write in a given way. You needs to like to have your argument very strong for lots of experiments.&amp;rdquo; I think there are multiple, it can be a little bit more lightweight let&amp;rsquo;s say, when I talk about research in general. But there is a level of rigor that is important, which is related to the critical thinking, which is really like, okay, and I&amp;rsquo;m just like, I just woke up in the morning and I thought about something. I say, &amp;ldquo;Ah, this is true, or this is the thing.&amp;rdquo; Because I think it is. I don&amp;rsquo;t think there is any rigor on that. It&amp;rsquo;s just like someone has their experience and they&amp;rsquo;re right about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;rsquo;s not what I mean by research itself. It&amp;rsquo;s really like, try to create an argument. And it&amp;rsquo;s hard when I talk about argument, because when you think about argument, you think about two people fighting. That&amp;rsquo;s not what I mean by an argument. So an argument is really like, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m trying to justify why I believe on something.&amp;rdquo; Rather than just like, &amp;ldquo;I believe on something, this is the truth.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s like, &amp;ldquo;I believe on this and those are the reasons. This is the reasoning behind why I believe on that something.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is the level of rigor that we need to have in any research. And sometimes to justify, we need to do full experiments and all those things. That&amp;rsquo;s when there&amp;rsquo;s really like professional research. We need to do experiments, we need to do like a lot of literature research to synthesize literature to justify why you believe on something. But it can be very simple, really like checking a few sources, checking from your experience as well, mixing those things to justify why you believe that something&amp;rsquo;s true of something is the case. So that is a level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I like when you say that, when you specify that it&amp;rsquo;s an argument, but not between two people. And it kind of made me think about how when I write something and something that I&amp;rsquo;ve done research on, I like to use steel man arguments. And the idea, I mean you maybe know this, but just to explain to other people, there&amp;rsquo;s something called a straw man where sometimes in order to prove a point, people construct this very flimsy argument and then they show how it&amp;rsquo;s wrong. But I really love constructing a steel man which is a contradicting point of view that is actually valid in some ways. And that way, when you are able to convincingly show that that steel man is incorrect or inaccurate, then it kind of strengthens your own premise. And in that way, it&amp;rsquo;s like an argument not between two people, but kind of between conflicting ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yes, yes, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I wanna shout out as well, there&amp;rsquo;s some people who are saying they use Obsidian for both academic and non-academic research. So Grisha is agreeing that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if the purpose of the research is for academia. And even William who&amp;rsquo;s a retired academic, agrees with you about research as knowledge creation. And a note about another Brazilian talking about PKM and Obsidian. They&amp;rsquo;re a cybersecurity researcher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;taking-notes-for-topic-research&#34;&gt;Taking notes for topic research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: There&amp;rsquo;s a question here from Jan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could taking notes help in topic research? Using Obsidian to write random notes. And I&amp;rsquo;m interested if I could somehow use it to get some ideas for my thesis engineering field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a perfect question for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: I would say you can have a whole system just to help your research. That&amp;rsquo;s the area that I like to talk about. So you can spend one hour, even more hours here just talking about that. But I suppose that you were saying to get idea, so it&amp;rsquo;s really the beginning of the process of research. So it&amp;rsquo;s really like, what do I research about? And I would say definitely, you can definitely use your notes for that. I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may agree with me, Nicole, that our research, our notes taking space, note making space is really to put our thoughts in there, to let our minds really flow into the page or in our case, to the digital page. So when it comes to identifying the top, the first thing that we actually need is like, what are our interests? What do we care about? What do you want to work on? What will be spending, if you are thinking about the research topic, what do you spend the next years work on? So it needs to be something that you have interested in learning more about. So I think our note making space is a perfect place to just like put things out. What are the things that I like? Let me write everything I know about them so that you can then decide, okay, which one I want to maybe pursue, so investigate a little bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think that would be, and I would say, you ask, Jan, could you take notes? Could take notes help topic recency? Definitely. I think that would be one step that would definitely help in defining what is the topic for your research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually plan on doing this, but I&amp;rsquo;m gonna share my screen because this is something I&amp;rsquo;ve thought about a lot as well. So I have this thing called lightning rods of thought. It&amp;rsquo;s actually from a D&amp;amp;D or an RPG person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sly Flourish is a YouTuber who has the idea of using lightning rods, which is adding things in a game that cause the players to use abilities that they already have. So it&amp;rsquo;s kind of like attracting what the abilities and interests that they already have. So I had this idea of lightning rods of thought. And this is how I try to find out what things I&amp;rsquo;m interested in. I mean, there are many ways, this is one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is a Dataview query that I use and it says, it spits out all of the notes that I have by the number of outgoing links, and this is just the top 50. But I am trying to identify maps of content, for example, and it&amp;rsquo;s going by descending order on outgoing. And then there&amp;rsquo;s also incoming links. So you could look at it that way. How many notes do you have that are linking to certain notes? And it&amp;rsquo;s like, these are the things that I am interested in apparently. So it&amp;rsquo;s just useful for me to start here. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that I stop here, of course. And I can also embed searches for different keywords. And sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s useful to look at orphans, the things that have no links to them. And I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why. Maybe I should think about that. That&amp;rsquo;s just as an aside, I didn&amp;rsquo;t intend to show that, but I thought it was kind of relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yeah, I think this is really good. I do something similar, although I don&amp;rsquo;t have the queries anymore &amp;lsquo;cause I&amp;rsquo;m not actively using Obsidian, but I do a similar thing, which I call it generalizations. So you&amp;rsquo;re like, what are the things that are making everything else be glued to each other? Let&amp;rsquo;s say, what are the central topics that everything is linked to or who is linking to everything else? Usually take the ones that is everything links to that, those are the things that I have been working around them a lot. So those are the core for my system as well, so I&amp;rsquo;ll do something similar so that&amp;rsquo;s really nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, it sounds like the same thing. It&amp;rsquo;s like abstraction and finding the highest level of abstraction. And from there, you can start digging into it. So I guess to answer the question that Jan asked, yes, they could definitely help. Taking notes could help in topic research. And one way that you can try to find out what topics you&amp;rsquo;re interested in is by trying to find these clusters, like what Bianca said, the generalized, the most generalized topics that you tend to write notes around. There&amp;rsquo;s another question for you from Grisha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bianca, do you first take notes on paper and then put them in Obsidian?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: No. I still love and in paper, I love it, but there is just no time. So for me everything is like, phone all the time or in the computer is direct and digital because there is just no time. Especially now with small kids, there&amp;rsquo;s just like not an option anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I definitely get that it&amp;rsquo;s hard. I always have a real notebook and a fountain pen. But my usage of it has shifted to like journaling and brainstorming and not really like as you say, Bianca, sense making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ai-for-research-and-note-taking&#34;&gt;AI for research and note-taking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Nikhil asks, &amp;ldquo;If applicable, have you come up with a workflow regarding materials? PDFs, videos, etc. to use an Obsidian, ChatGPT or GPT3? I&amp;rsquo;m looking to use it for academic research.&amp;rdquo; Have you looked into that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: I use ChatGPT most for copy edit for editing. It&amp;rsquo;s really, really good. I was doing a try, I was okay if I want to do a literature review. A base one like a scoping review, which is like the very first type of, could I use that? I even published it on Twitter sometime ago and ChatGPT has some good things and some very bad things. Sometimes, it&amp;rsquo;s just retrieving information that is random. I know there are people who use for example to summarize the source. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to read the whole source, you just want to know does it talk about it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people use for that. I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried to use for that. I prefer to process my source in a different way. But those are, I think the best, best, best section on the writing process where it&amp;rsquo;s actually like, &amp;ldquo;Okay, I wrote it this way, can you edit a little bit and see if sounds a little bit better?&amp;rdquo; So I think for copy editing and ChatGPT is really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, I want to add that I also made a video on AI for PKM. I talk about things like using &lt;a href=&#34;https://napkin.one/?via=nicole&#34;&gt;Napkin&lt;/a&gt;. Napkin is something that brings in your highlights from Readwise and auto and in a smart way uses GPT3 to tag those highlights. So since Nikhil was asking about different materials, like PDFs and videos, if &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/nicole&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt; processes those, then Napkin could see those and start to intelligently make links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Obsidian in particular, since he asked about that, there&amp;rsquo;s text generator and someone from Mastodon, Rick Raftis actually wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@ricraftis/how-to-use-elicit-research-artificial-intelligence-for-better-results-9d12b611eb3d&#34;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; that I found really interesting and it is about using Elicit and Consensus, which I don&amp;rsquo;t really know much about, but I thought that the blog post was interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-canvas-vs-scrintal&#34;&gt;Obsidian Canvas vs. Scrintal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And so what else is there? (Reading a comment in Spanish)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greetings from Chile. Últimamente he estado utilizando canva para hacer presentaciones para mis clases, de modo que cuando actualizo la nota citada en la presentación, se actualiza de inmediato visual&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(English) Oh I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even highlight that. So just to translate here, for those who don&amp;rsquo;t speak Spanish. This person is saying Greetings from Chile and they&amp;rsquo;ve been using Canvas, which is an Obsidian feature to create presentations for their classes. And so that when one note that is cited in the presentation is changed, then that Canvas is automatically updated. That this is a really good use case for it. And maybe this is a good time to also talk about another alternative for Canvas, because Canvas is for Obsidian and in many ways, I think it&amp;rsquo;s Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s answer to Scrintal. What do you think about that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s true. Yeah, just for who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know, I was a very passionate, obviously the user until I found Scrintal. Which kind of strange. I still love Obsidian, but I don&amp;rsquo;t use it anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Scrintal is an app where you can visually organize your notes. So Obsidian has Canva so you can decide to, let&amp;rsquo;s say just start with Canva, it&amp;rsquo;s more like organized in those stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s too easy to create new notes in Canva, but in Scrintal, everything is visual. So you always like to create a note and then the note appears a card already in the background from what you&amp;rsquo;re creating. So it&amp;rsquo;s really to visually organize the notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it started before Obsidian and then Obsidian appear with confidence, like features, features, features. So there and there is now also Logseq, which appears now with whiteboard. I didn&amp;rsquo;t check yet, but people are saying that it&amp;rsquo;s actually also really good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So yeah, I became a Scrintal user at some time ago. Mostly because I was using the phone and the phone at the time, Obsidian didn&amp;rsquo;t have the mobile app. And for me, one of the main challenge that I had is like, okay, I&amp;rsquo;m writing something and then I write too many notes and just like start linking and connect to the note. And I jumped another note, jumped to another note, jumped another note. And I always found it hard to remember where did I come from. I was like, &amp;ldquo;Where did I come from? Where was I working again before I jump into this note?&amp;rdquo; And Scrintal gave me that automatic note. As I&amp;rsquo;m creating the notes, the notes are in the background. As soon as I close it, i have all the other notes there. They&amp;rsquo;re in that same visual space, the same context, let&amp;rsquo;s say. So that&amp;rsquo;s what made me change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed at some point, I was using less Obsidian I was getting kind of stuck in my way of writing notes, in my way of thinking. And then Scrintal was kind of like accelerating, I was like, okay. And that&amp;rsquo;s when I did the change and it was before Canva, before the mobile app was released as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: We have a question here from Mickael Fortunato.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the way, Bianca, are you only relying on Scrintal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yeah, nowadays for idea management, yes. Now, I moved with everything into Scrintal now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-important-is-visual-thinking-in-pkm&#34;&gt;How important is visual thinking in PKM?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So let&amp;rsquo;s talk about this a little bit because I was also an early user of Scrintal. I think I talked to the team before it was released and gave my feedback. Ultimately, I decided that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t for me. I actually really liked the visual part of it. I really, really liked it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I didn&amp;rsquo;t like about it was that it&amp;rsquo;s not plain text markdown files anymore. That view, I mean Canvas is the same. If you use Obsidian Canvas, that&amp;rsquo;s no longer a standard format, which is also why I hesitate to use it because I just really like plain text. But I do love the idea of adding, of bringing in visual thinking into note taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s very visceral because when we see a note or even like something that looks like a note on the screen, instinctively, we know how to use it because that is a metaphor for an actual piece of paper that we can interact with. What do you think about visual thinking? Do you think that it&amp;rsquo;s always necessary for research or is it just something, another avenue that might be useful?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: I find it, personally, extremely important. And the main reason is when you talk about knowledge creation, we need to be able to get our ideas, to put ideas together. Sometimes a big number of ideas so that we can create something from them or take them and break them down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for example, I talk like about sense-making strategies, they&amp;rsquo;re usually like you put the ideas on a space which will be a board, let&amp;rsquo;s say. And how now we can connect them, create new things from them, generalize from them, see the context about them. In all those steps when you&amp;rsquo;re playing with ideas, then you can be creating new ideas. Because what I notice that sometimes, we just take notes about, let&amp;rsquo;s say, what you found, our source. we have quotes, quotes, quotes. But then what is the idea?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end, of the day we want to create knowledge. Where are our ideas? So even my whole note, note making is like each note is one idea, which some people they call the atomic notes, although I don&amp;rsquo;t know anymore because we have many discussions with people who take atomic notes and we have some disagreements. So basically like each node is an idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when you take ideas and you put them into a board for example, they&amp;rsquo;ll start to organize them. Or where things that are similar, somehow they can be closer together. If they have another type of similarity, you can now add color to them. If you have available shapes, shapes can have meaning as well. So if all those things you can start rearranging the ideas, organizing, grouping them and seeing how can I find the relations between them and which new ideas come out just by putting those things together?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visual organization of notes is very important for knowledge creation itself because then, you can see the ideas and reflect about them so they can create something from them. Which pure text usually is really hard to do with pure text. Or with just like 10 notes around the screen, but not in a visual organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So this is a related question from Jan:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When is creating a Canvas or something similar necessary? Is it not tedious to do every time?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Well, my take is that it&amp;rsquo;s important to see why you want to create that. Do you want that as a navigational board for example. If you want to have an overview of everything, your vaults for example. Can you have one board that gives you the entry point to all these spaces in your board, in your vault? That&amp;rsquo;s one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things that you can use for, or can use as a sense-making space, you can bring up some notes or cards that you want to make sense of or create something from that. But I would not say that it&amp;rsquo;s always necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, all we want is just like open a note and do a brain dump, for example. Don&amp;rsquo;t need a board for that. Or you just want to work on the content of one single note. Maybe explain a little bit more what their ideas about, so we don&amp;rsquo;t really need a board for that or Canvas for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think it depends a lot from what you want to do. What do you think, Nicole? What would be your use for Canva?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, I think, I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna say it&amp;rsquo;s necessary because I just hate imposing what I think on other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, some element of visualization is always necessary. Yeah. And sometimes, that is me drawing up like an atomic visual from the beginning and other times, I&amp;rsquo;m just all text and then I rearrange the text on Canvas or something or Excalidraw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then other times it&amp;rsquo;s all purely based on the relationships and I&amp;rsquo;m just visualizing those links in either the graph view or ExcaliBrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think our visual processing as humans is much more advanced than maybe other senses. Like common sense isn&amp;rsquo;t common, right? So it is something that we actively have to practice. And so having these visual shortcuts I think is really helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for me, it&amp;rsquo;s always necessary, but I don&amp;rsquo;t always go to the extreme for everything &amp;lsquo;cause yeah, that would be tedious in that case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;note-taking-in-multiple-languages&#34;&gt;Note-taking in multiple languages&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to jump into Scrintal because it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve last seen it, but I can&amp;rsquo;t resist this question from Deb Leg who says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who also juggles languages, I&amp;rsquo;m curious to know how your knowledge of several languages impacts your thoughts or notes process and which languages you use for research and knowledge creation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: That&amp;rsquo;s interesting. I just use English all the time. Because I figured I started my research journey even when I was in Brazil, everything was in English, all papers were in English and for computer science all technical language was in English, so everything was always English. So I decided to just have one language for my specific, I don&amp;rsquo;t even know how to call it more knowledge base vaults or anything, I like to call knowledge base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But one thing that is interesting that I was discussing with one of the members of my community the other day is that &amp;lsquo;cause you&amp;rsquo;re saying, well, I write in English and in Japanese. And one of the things that we notice with languages is that there is translation and there is how can I actually express this idea in a different language? And sometimes, translation is not the way to doing that. Because I always say, &amp;ldquo;Well if you take notes, for example, if our notes represent an idea, the title of the note is the name for that. How do we call that idea?&amp;rdquo; And sometimes, how we call that idea in English is not just a translation from stock in Japanese or in Portuguese. It&amp;rsquo;s like how do we call that idea in one language and how do we call that idea into the other language?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s one one of the interesting things because I think the main challenge now is really like if you write in two languages, when it&amp;rsquo;s time to search for your notes, which language would you use to search? So it&amp;rsquo;s really hard. It&amp;rsquo;s like, which word did I use? Did I translate? So one thing could be like, okay, I have a title in both languages, if that&amp;rsquo;s important idea, just have, how do I call that idea in two different languages. But it is really hard to find later if you&amp;rsquo;re not very disciplined on how we name our ideas or how we write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: For me, I can&amp;rsquo;t really control it all the time. I think my daily notes for instance, are in a jumble of languages, whatever I was thinking in at that time. So they are messy. But what I do is at the end of the day, I then process it and then I do translate most of it to English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things are naturally in English for me. Like I study, so my native language is Tagalog, English is a second language and it is my best non-native language. It is also the language that I studied in. So when I talk about anything that is like mathematical or computer science related, because in programming, even the keywords are in English, so it makes sense for me to translate those into English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what I&amp;rsquo;ll do is I&amp;rsquo;ll have an alias in Obsidian with something that I might refer to it as in another language. So for example, performance testing is the main note for it in English. And I&amp;rsquo;ll put an alias that is &amp;ldquo;pruebas de carga&amp;rdquo; which is the same thing in Spanish because I might be searching for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I also noticed that with people, the notes tend to be in whatever language I was speaking to them in. So if I&amp;rsquo;m speaking to someone in Dutch, then my notes will be in Dutch &amp;lsquo;cause that kind of makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Omar Ortiz Meraz is saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, I reserve each language based on topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I have a bunch of private notes around relationships and relationship dynamics that are in Tagalog because that&amp;rsquo;s how I think with relationships. And looks like Omar&amp;rsquo;s also saying English for technical things, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filipino, Tagalog and English here too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, (Filipino) compatriot, how are you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;demo-of-scrintal&#34;&gt;Demo of Scrintal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: (English) Let&amp;rsquo;s get into Scrintal, Bianca, if you don&amp;rsquo;t mind showing us what it looks like now. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while. It&amp;rsquo;s been like months, maybe a year since I looked at it. Should I add it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yeah. Can you add? Can you see my cursor or?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yes, we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yeah, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Scrintal, the hard part is that you are faced with a blank screen and you&amp;rsquo;re like, okay, there is a world of possibilities but I have no idea how to start. So it&amp;rsquo;s really like you can just create a note, which is called card here in&amp;hellip; I like to think like it&amp;rsquo;s similar to the physical world, let&amp;rsquo;s say. You have your desk, you can double click or create that to create a card where you can just write wherever you want and create a title. My idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then they also have this slash comments to actually add things. A link to a card or a link to a board. You can link to from a card to a board. Upload things, emails, add YouTube videos, tweets, upload, and the normal formatting that we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if I want to create a link to another idea, I could just here plus. And then there&amp;rsquo;s another idea. So let&amp;rsquo;s say they all just appear on the screen and if you just close everything, they are there in the board already linked to each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So basically that&amp;rsquo;s the basic idea of Scrintal. So you have cards, you can have a desk and you can have a board, which is exactly the same thing of a desk, but you can save a board and give a name to the board. The desk is just one, where boards, you can create as many as you want. So you can just click here. Or for example, if I want to create a board with those, I just right-click, create a board. And then I have this new board, which I can give it a name and add a link for example, inside. Inside of here. So this is a link becomes a link to board rather than linked to a card for example. And it has similarly like have backlinks. So it appears when you have links to boards. In which boards does this card appear? Because a card exists in the panel, the board. It can appear as in multiple boards, it can be no boards at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s all those things appear there. And if you want to see the rest here, then you can see all the cards that you have, all the boards you can share, you can actually have multiple people work in the same board. The same set of cards. And here, you can have just a normal search that you can search to find the boards or the cards again. So the cards they exist independent of anything, you can add them to your desk, you can add them to a board. So I can go out here and here on my desk. For example, I clear my desk, my desk is empty. But then the board, you still have those two cards. So you can use a board as an MOC for example if you want. You can use a board to make sense of things and save. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty similar tool to combine that sense because you can also link Canva I think in Obsidian as well. So those are the main feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can add color as well if you want. You can add tags. Yeah, those are the main things the Scrintal has at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So we have two questions here on what were also my objections. Rodrigo Alexandre Costa:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrintal&amp;rsquo;s cards or boards format is proprietary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a related one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you export your notes from Scrintal?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s one thing that I have been asking the team for many months, the exporting part. They are working now on a full export of all the cards. Currently, can export one by one in Markdown or by just all the PDF, but they&amp;rsquo;re working on a export all feature. So it should be here, I think in the next months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of proprietary, yeah, they just have their own format. They don&amp;rsquo;t share what&amp;rsquo;s the format, but then you can export in Markdown. So ideally, in the future you could have, let&amp;rsquo;s say you write your things in Obsidian, you upload into Scrintal, you change the things there, there download, put back into Obsidian. So you can ideally be able to use both for depending what he wants to do. But yeah, we are not there yet if anyone wants to use that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I wanna say that to be fair, Canvas is the same way. So the Obsidian team hasn&amp;rsquo;t quite figured it out either. That&amp;rsquo;s kind of why I&amp;rsquo;m hesitant to use it because it&amp;rsquo;s no longer Markdown. And technically though, the format is not proprietary, Rodrigo. I don&amp;rsquo;t know about Scrintal, but for Obsidian, it is in JSON. So it is a standard format, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t nice to work with. It isn&amp;rsquo;t really something that you can export to another app or something. I imagine that the Scrintal team are facing the same limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yeah, well to be fair with Obsidian as well, this is a very new area. Like just now, there is like Scrintal, Obsidian and Logseq pushing into that direction. So there are really not no open standards to deal with this type of data because even the different tools are trying to figure out what is it that you&amp;rsquo;re creating, what is it that we want to represent, how we can represent that information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think it would be very good to like, if in let&amp;rsquo;s say five years time maybe, or hopefully before, there will be open standards for those and multiple apps who maybe even work together to try to create those open standards that they all support. So I say, fingers crossed, that will be the future. But yeah, so far, I&amp;rsquo;m not even sure if there is any open store that would cater for this type of use case. So let&amp;rsquo;s see where it will go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I think the closest one would be Mermaid.js. which Obsidian does support, but you have to learn it. And it&amp;rsquo;s also not as flexible as Scrintal is for example. I want to ask about the board and desk concept though. It kind of sounds like their analogous to maybe folders and subfolders or is that completely wrong?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Well, first there is no subfolders. You cannot have a board inside of a board, for example, board is a separate thing. And they&amp;rsquo;re not totally, they are similar a folder in the sense of container. Like it can bring things inside of it, let&amp;rsquo;s say. You can put cards inside of a board, but the same card can&amp;rsquo;t exist in multiple boards. So they don&amp;rsquo;t have the limitations of a folder because in a folder, like you put on a folder and that&amp;rsquo;s it. You cannot really put in multiple, you can create shortcuts, but that&amp;rsquo;s another story. But then really like folders, is this folder or in that folder? Whereas boards is really like, okay, you can just put on a board, remove, put it back again, put in five different boards. So the boards are much more flexible in that sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;taking-notes-on-source-material&#34;&gt;Taking notes on source material&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So there are a few questions about how you would actually use these boards for research. So for starters, someone said if you were taking or making notes from an article, would you make many atomic notes or one main note? And then my question is, would you also like create a single board for that article and have all of your notes on there? Or would you make a board per day? And then a follow up question is from Jan who is asking about the serendipity aspect of it. So what if you just want to be able to explore your notes and discover new ones?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Just try to remember everything. I remember this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the input one, as I said, like I work with idea note, let&amp;rsquo;s say, so each note is one idea. So when you&amp;rsquo;re reading a source, there are tons of ideas in the source that you want to capture and understand. And there are main ideas that spring out. Why are you reading the source? So I have like tons of notes that come out from reading one single source. So I have multiple notes from that. They all link back to the source, but I have multiple notes on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in my case, I&amp;rsquo;m playing now with creating a board for that because someone asked me the same question, I&amp;rsquo;m like, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t create a board for that.&amp;rdquo; So I was like, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll try and see if there is any benefit of doing that.&amp;rdquo; I did not find any benefits so far, unless you want to make sense of all those ideas together. But then you can create a board later. But while I&amp;rsquo;m reading a paper, I don&amp;rsquo;t really use a board. I just like, there are many ideas that I start to, many notes, many cards that I start to create, create, create, create. But I don&amp;rsquo;t actually create a board for that specific input. I don&amp;rsquo;t see any specific utility unless I want to make sense of those ideas even in isolation from the source or get group of ideas or things like that. Yeah, so that&amp;rsquo;s that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So Niky Dix seems to be familiar with your work. They say that you have a brilliant method for using a combination using OneNote and then making atomic notes. Can you explain what they mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yeah, well Nik is from our community. Because there is a process. one thing is like for example, how I do it, I create many notes. And what I talk about this, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if Niky is referring to that, is the idea when we have the bibliographic note where like I call the input note, it&amp;rsquo;s a note that represents the source itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this my note that represents the source and I have all my ideas linking to that source. And the reason why I link to that note and not direct to the source then I am talking about is because then I can see, I can answer two questions. One is where this idea came from because it has a link to the source and the other is like, what are all the ideas that came out from this source? So just go into the note, the backlinks shows me all the ideas that are related to this source. So I think maybe that&amp;rsquo;s the what Nik&amp;rsquo;s talking about. Using the OneNote to represent the source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I don&amp;rsquo;t use a board to represent the source to say, ah, this is the source and all the ideas in the source. Instead, I have one note and all the notes that refer to that are linked back to that source. So the backlinks by now can take, what are all the ideas that came out from that source? I don&amp;rsquo;t know, Nik, is that what you&amp;rsquo;re referring to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Another person is also asking, &amp;ldquo;So you have a base note for the source and connect all notes?&amp;rdquo; So if I understand what you&amp;rsquo;re saying, yes, you have a note that is for that source and then you either explicitly connect other notes that have, like, you create notes of ideas from that source and you either explicitly link them or rely on backlinks to connect them to the base note. Is that right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;on-the-usefulness-of-highlights&#34;&gt;On the usefulness of highlights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And is it like, do you use something Readwise to do that? Or do you just manually create a base note?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: I manually create, and actually, I was teaching a few weeks ago and one of the outcomes was that many people say, &amp;ldquo;Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll remove my Readwise subscription.&amp;rdquo; because I&amp;rsquo;m really like, the whole flow, I talk like, highlight is good, but use highlight as a way to say, this is my note. There are many shortcuts especially for research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Cause in research, you want to create knowledge. So our note should not be just a highlight. It&amp;rsquo;s like how can we have our own understanding inside of our system? And Readwise sometimes like, okay, I highlighted this in Readwise I can just put later into my system. And what usually happens that when we take that approach, let&amp;rsquo;s say we highlight and see we process later, later never arrives. So we end up just like our notes are just highlights, but we never process our understanding of what are the ideas that came out from reading that, from try to understanding that So that was like, well maybe highlight is good for when you want to reread the source, but if it&amp;rsquo;s the process of understanding, really need to write down what is our understanding. And if we use a tool that just say highlight to see it later, later never arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, I think that&amp;rsquo;s when the problem is when you treat something like Readwise or any read it later app as the end of the process, then that&amp;rsquo;s still a very superficial way of learning really. I kind of treat it as the beginning. And then I process it from there. Jan is saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you mean highlighting encourages resource hoarding rather than taking notes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely think it does. Do you agree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yeah, I agree. Like especially when it&amp;rsquo;s highlight only. If it&amp;rsquo;s highlight only, then I think that&amp;rsquo;s the worst of the worst. Because sometimes, okay, I highlight and then Readwise, you just create my notes. I just import from Readwise into my Obsidian for example, and I have my notes with my highlights. But then like, so what? Those are other people&amp;rsquo;s words, other people&amp;rsquo;s thoughts, something they try to communicate, but what did we understand for that? What do we try to do with that? I think it means a little bit in the personal knowledge management. So I totally agree with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-one-pass-reading-strategy&#34;&gt;The one-pass reading strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So Niky Dix is saying that he was referring to the one pass strategy where we use free writing from one source and then make idea notes using the pick a phrase and then create idea notes and reverse outline. Okay, we need to unpack this. Can you explain what he means?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. As a solution to this process, the highlight and the process later and later never arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when it comes the time to write from our research, there are no notes. Because we didn&amp;rsquo;t actually process those highlights with our understanding and build the knowledge that we want to write about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what I develop is what I call the one pass reading strategy. So that is when you finish reading, you have all your notes ready. Even if you stop in the middle, you are ready, have all your notes ready for you. So the process where you go, I develop a process step by step how we can do that. And that&amp;rsquo;s where all those words come from. We are reading something, we feel the urge to highlight something was either interesting, relevant, or puzzling. We stop immediately rather than just highlight and keep moving on, we stop and then start making sense of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s really like, let me free write and just write my understanding of what I just read. Even try to explain what the person tried to tell me or try to explain how does it relate to my work or anything that comes to mind really. So just really like free writing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then when you talk about idea notes, many people use the thing of atomic notes, I say, or idea notes as like, okay, what are the ideas in the highlighting? And that&amp;rsquo;s why I say don&amp;rsquo;t do that. The highlight is someone else ideas. You want to extract the atomic notes from what you wrote from your free wrote. Because those are your ideas, even if they&amp;rsquo;re just an explanation of what the person said. So those are the ones that become the atomic notes. And then you may want to cite to mention, okay, these thoughts actually are not mine. They came when reading this quote from the source. So that I can say, this is not mine, it came from this source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then that&amp;rsquo;s where I use and some methods that I teach on how to create those idea notes. Those are the pick a phrase and the reverse outline methods. So those are some methods that to help convert a free writing into idea notes. So that&amp;rsquo;s a little bit of what Nik was referring to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Okay. So what&amp;rsquo;s so interesting is that you&amp;rsquo;re using different terminology, but I&amp;rsquo;ve kind of arrived at the same conclusion, at the same process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think like Tiago Forte uses the term progressive summarization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And since you&amp;rsquo;re a developer, I like to think of it as like continuous note taking in the sense of CI/CD processes. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, in tech, we are now emphasizing a more agile way to work where that is more iterative. So it&amp;rsquo;s not like in the first pass, you get everything down and you&amp;rsquo;re done and you move on. It&amp;rsquo;s like you do, it kind of sounds like what you&amp;rsquo;re describing, Bianca, where the initial pass is like freeform. You&amp;rsquo;re not really separating things out yet. You&amp;rsquo;re just getting through it and then you go back and iterate over it, and then you start creating idea notes that are now in your words, not in the author&amp;rsquo;s words. And then you keep like continually processing it from there. So I&amp;rsquo;m seeing kind of a lot of similarities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think that it is significantly different from other methodologies like Zettelkasten or progressive summarization?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: I cannot say that I understand completely progressive summarization or the Zettelkasten. What I understand, progressive summarization is that you stop too much on the source side of things. It&amp;rsquo;s like you try to highlight and summarize, is it too much on what the other process try to say, and it takes too much time to arrive on you, let&amp;rsquo;s say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas my case, let&amp;rsquo;s say like as soon as you write something that is important, your thoughts should go down, your thoughts should go there immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I agree with you on the agile process, actually even the people in the community, they heard me talking about agile a little bit because even I call agile note making. Because like yeah, let&amp;rsquo;s I compare to I guess the waterfall. So there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of like computer science things going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Oh, that&amp;rsquo;s awesome. I love that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yeah, so-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of the same thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yeah, so it&amp;rsquo;s really like the process of really iterative. It&amp;rsquo;s really like put your thoughts out. Because one of the big problems that people have in note making or in writing, especially in research, is that we try to organize first rather than create the things first or express our thoughts first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it happens in some note making tools. They force you to think about that because okay, where would I put this note even when I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I write inside of the note yet. Whereas I see more like, first you express what you want to say. I don&amp;rsquo;t even know what I&amp;rsquo;m gonna say, then just write it all down. And then the process of organizing those notes so that I can find them later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the atomic note is really a process of organization. We are trying to organize our ideas in a way that we can grow them, using some sense making strategies or we want to find them later. I see that that&amp;rsquo;s why like the process really like. Write everything down first, then you express yourself. Now let&amp;rsquo;s start to organize as a second step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;nicole-showing-her-process&#34;&gt;Nicole showing her process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So I want to show quickly this something that&amp;rsquo;s in the process of me going through and creating and synthesizing my thoughts on it. This is an example of highlights from Readwise. And as you say, this is really like, it&amp;rsquo;s all source, there&amp;rsquo;s none of my own thoughts in here, but it&amp;rsquo;s like a prompt for me. It&amp;rsquo;s the beginning and then I remember what I thought was interesting about it, and then I create another note but that is about still what the author is saying, but now it&amp;rsquo;s in my words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I like this thesis, an antithesis, antithesis and synthesis kind of structure. It&amp;rsquo;s the Hegelian dialect and I like that in the first one I talk about what are the main part points of the book? What is the author trying to say? But in my own words. And then I also think about similar ideas that other authors I know or have read, wrote about or said about the situation. Then antithesis is like, what are the things that are wrong or what are the weak points of that book? And then how can they come together?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So obviously, I&amp;rsquo;m not done with this one and it&amp;rsquo;s still in progress, but I just wanted to show how it can be done like in Obsidian as well. I guess in Scrintal, this would be&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m interested that the process is really very similar. It&amp;rsquo;s just, okay, the tool is different, but we&amp;rsquo;re actually doing the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;which-tool-is-best&#34;&gt;Which tool is best?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yeah. This one, I like to say like, because most people they ask, &amp;ldquo;Okay, which tool should I be using? Should I then move to Scrintal?&amp;rdquo; I was like, &amp;ldquo;Wait, what do you want to do?&amp;rdquo; Because it&amp;rsquo;s more about which type of thinking we are trying to support and then which methods we can use to put that way of thinking to practice. And then what is the tool that I want to use?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So many people say they started with Obsidian, they say, &amp;ldquo;Well that&amp;rsquo;s not for me. I want something else.&amp;rdquo; And they go to Scrintal. Some people start Scrintal, they say, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not for me. I want something else. They go into Obsidian.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s really like, what do you want to do with the tool? What method supports that? And then, okay, which tool will support me in applying that method? So I like to think more on the mindset, what I call the mindset, and then the methods. Then choose, what&amp;rsquo;s then the best tool for my use case or for this specific use case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I can maybe share my personal screen. I was saying that I was, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Totally up to you. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to, but yeah, sure. But I really love what you&amp;rsquo;re saying about tools because people think like, &amp;ldquo;Oh, my channel&amp;rsquo;s about Obsidian so I must think that Obsidian is the best tool for everyone.&amp;rdquo; I don&amp;rsquo;t, I hate saying something is the best for everyone. I&amp;rsquo;m like the opposite of that. That is the opposite of inclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always say try it out. a lot of these tools are free or have a free trial or a free tier. Use it all. And if that&amp;rsquo;s Notion or if that&amp;rsquo;s Evernote or Obsidian, like go for it. We all think in different ways. Why do we assume that one tool will placate all of us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Exactly. I totally agree with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, if you&amp;rsquo;d like to share your screen, you can-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ll try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Just go ahead and do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;languages-as-thinking-hats&#34;&gt;Languages as thinking hats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And Nik was also saying:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write first, organize later. Sounds like what Nicole did with her daily notes in multiple languages too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely, that is exactly it. My daily note is kind of like Bianca&amp;rsquo;s one pass process, what is it called? One pass reading. And that&amp;rsquo;s because it&amp;rsquo;s just like a log. There are bullet points. I am not really thinking too much about what language I&amp;rsquo;m writing in, but then when they get processed, I mean, very few people are going to want to read a single article in multiple languages that might not coincide with their languages, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mage Prometheus says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing down your own words immediately helps identify where you don&amp;rsquo;t understand. I don&amp;rsquo;t like to read on if I don&amp;rsquo;t understand what I&amp;rsquo;ve just read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and I would also add to this, something I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention with the multiple languages question is I actually use my knowledge of multiple languages to test myself. And kind of like the question that was asked earlier about AI. One thing that I am actively using AI for is to provide me the opposing argument. Here&amp;rsquo;s what I think, tell me what&amp;rsquo;s wrong. And that is super cool because sometimes the AI, GPT3. or GPT4 says things and I&amp;rsquo;m like, I should have thought of that. That&amp;rsquo;s actually a pretty solid argument that has me rethinking how I should argue, how I should present my evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I do the same thing with languages because I find that for me at least, like certain languages are linked with certain attitudes. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of like the six hats, the thinking hats from Edward de Bono. That&amp;rsquo;s what languages are for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I have a premise out there and I think I want to attack this logically, I might try English because that for me is the logical language. But if I want to think about like, well what does this mean in terms of people? I might do Filipino, Tagalog or Spanish. Then if it&amp;rsquo;s something that&amp;rsquo;s more like, about freedom or liberty, okay, let&amp;rsquo;s do the same thing in Dutch and let&amp;rsquo;s see what I come up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s actually interesting, the things that I come up with just from putting the same thoughts in two different languages. It&amp;rsquo;s like, why did I use that word in Dutch? But I didn&amp;rsquo;t use a direct translation in English. It&amp;rsquo;s like, okay, that&amp;rsquo;s kind of interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s why you see like it&amp;rsquo;s really about the idea itself, not the words. Because when you start to thinking what is the name for this idea? That&amp;rsquo;s where it&amp;rsquo;s like, oh, okay, what am I actually trying to say here? What&amp;rsquo;s the idea that I try to talk about? So I find that fascinating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: And also agglutinative languages like German, Dutch or even Esperanto, they just let you freeform, push two ideas together that maybe don&amp;rsquo;t belong. And I love that. We can&amp;rsquo;t just do that in other languages. So it&amp;rsquo;s super useful from that perspective. Just putting a name on a feeling or an idea is so powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sparking-serendipity-in-research&#34;&gt;Sparking serendipity in research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I want to get to the question earlier about serendipity, &amp;lsquo;cause I think that&amp;rsquo;s really important. So we&amp;rsquo;ve talked about how you process something for research, you have a base note for the source, you create idea notes that you pull out in kind of like an atomic note process. And then in the base note are things that are just more free form, but still in your own words, if I understand correctly, or is that like a separate note?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: I feel I can share now. I managed to share so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Oh, okay, great, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Just look at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: So that&amp;rsquo;s, for example, this will be what I call, it&amp;rsquo;s some people call biographic notes, literature note, it&amp;rsquo;s just an information, what it is, some videographic formation, what is the link. And for example, in here, I don&amp;rsquo;t have really anything. It&amp;rsquo;s just a summary. Very tiny one. &amp;lsquo;Cause i still write, see, I&amp;rsquo;m on page six. I read almost nothing from this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, those are the backlinks with the ideas that come out of it. There is sometimes information about the person or information about specific idea. And then I have some explanation here, which links to other things. So that&amp;rsquo;s really how I link. I explain the things and link back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I link, I link back to this note, so I can see here what are all the ideas that are related to it. So what I started doing, I started writing sometimes here just like free form, free writing. I just open here. There was something interesting, I just start writing here. And then I separated them as soon as I finished writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I started reading again, I separate them into their own notes or put into a note if already existed a note about that specific thing. And that&amp;rsquo;s how I go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I don&amp;rsquo;t keep my original free writing, I just like throw it away, except in some situations. Oh wow. Where it&amp;rsquo;s more like the decision but it&amp;rsquo;s more like I&amp;rsquo;m reporting, I&amp;rsquo;m writing a decision that I took or is more journaling, how I&amp;rsquo;m more about why am I moving my research in that direction? If it&amp;rsquo;s from a source, it cease to exist as one text. It&amp;rsquo;s actually existing multiple cards that&amp;rsquo;s breaking down into multiple cards about different ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I gotta say, that makes me anxious just thinking about it. You delete it? I do the same thing, but I keep the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yeah. I say, well if it makes you comfortable, keep it there. And maybe the daily note can come back the best. But for me, it&amp;rsquo;s just like&amp;hellip; Because it&amp;rsquo;s still there, but it&amp;rsquo;s nothing in one single text. It&amp;rsquo;s in multiple place. Each idea is a different note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So how would you stumble across? Like this note that you have, this sign or symbol. Is there any way that in Scrintal, you can stumble across that in a different context? Like not when you&amp;rsquo;re looking into this book?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yes, and sometimes, it happens with me because when you&amp;rsquo;re creating idea notes, when I talk about ideas, ideas are not just things, for example, this the example here, I have let&amp;rsquo;s say sign or double articulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We could think them as things or concepts, but I can say maybe like signs that have, no something say, double articulation, for example. Let&amp;rsquo;s a statement. I&amp;rsquo;m saying that signs have this property. So in that case, I will say sign. And just by doing that, many times, I started writing and I just say, okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll explain this idea here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a new idea from me. I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna talk about science or I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna talk about whatever the word articulation is. I want to talk about the relationship between them. And many times, when I&amp;rsquo;m doing that, I notice I may think that this doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist. I will write for the first time, but then as I&amp;rsquo;m writing I say, whoa, I have a note about that already. It happened many times. So when I start thinking about the relationships with between things, I start noticing, I have notes that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that I had before, and they have text in them, they have already content in them. I was like, whoa, I&amp;rsquo;m really happy with my previous self for having created a note for me, let&amp;rsquo;s say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in terms of serendipity in general, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say that Scrintal is focus on serendipity. It&amp;rsquo;s not like Napkin. Napkin focuses on serendipity. You open a note and two other notes just appear beside it. And so the focus of is really serendipity. Obsidian, you still have some plug, let&amp;rsquo;s say, give me a random note that is that level of serendipity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Scrintal, is really up to you. It&amp;rsquo;s really like, just open my card and open a random card and start to read again. And what I find interesting is that&amp;rsquo;s very often, we take notes, but we don&amp;rsquo;t read them. I mean, we always go to read something else from the external word, but we don&amp;rsquo;t read what our previous self wrote, let&amp;rsquo;s say. Very often. So I think a little bit of serendipity comes just by going to our vaults or our systems and reading our notes again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, there are a few ways that I like to do it. I think last week, I released a video just on Serendipity for Obsidian. But I think that the concepts are the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I do use Dice Roller for Obsidian to randomly select elements from tables or also notes. And you can say like, show me all the notes with this tag. Or you can do a bunch of different things with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I like to use that, but I also like to do chronologically. Like that&amp;rsquo;s why I used daily notes. In every daily note, I have a link that says like, one year ago today, here&amp;rsquo;s the daily note. And then I see what I was looking at or what I created on that day. And sometimes, I find seasonal things, like if I&amp;rsquo;m working on something for Christmas, it&amp;rsquo;s like, hey, this time last year I was working on that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s another way, by date, by topic, random or visualization, which I think Scrintal, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if Scrintal can, I guess it is good at letting you visualize different ideas, but is there a way to visualize all of the ideas? Like in all of the boards? I don&amp;rsquo;t really remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: No. Not yet. I tried, not a very good idea. I tried to put all my notes into on board and not yet. It just like didn&amp;rsquo;t open, everything crashed. It was just like, okay, lowsy, and we stayed there. I hope that the team has some ideas for that so you can actually see everything. But at the moment, there is no such option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-we-find-the-time-to-make-notes&#34;&gt;How do we find the time to make notes?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So we&amp;rsquo;re already over time. So I just wanted to end on one question from random user:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is there ever enough time to make notes on everything you&amp;rsquo;re interested in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: There is not enough time to make notes on everything you&amp;rsquo;re interested in, that would be the main answer. But I think for the notes that we can take, I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth taking the time to take and engage with them later on. So I feel that that would be my take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: That&amp;rsquo;s a really good answer. I totally agree, there&amp;rsquo;s never enough time. I relate so hard to this question because I want to take more notes on things than I actually have time to take notes on them. But just like anything else, prioritize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re not gonna be graded on this. Maybe you are actually. But for most other things, if you&amp;rsquo;re just a personal researcher, you&amp;rsquo;re not going to be graded on the thoroughness with which you attacked every single main premise that the author says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So feel free to pick the ones that are relevant to you for the work that you are doing. And I think that&amp;rsquo;s a much more sustainable way of doing things because you never have enough time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bianca, thank you so much for joining me. If people want to know more about you, as I&amp;rsquo;m sure they will, where would you suggest they go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Well, as we are on YouTube. I&amp;rsquo;m starting &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@BiaResearcher&#34;&gt;my YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;. I have some livestreams there, but I will start publishing more frequently. And can always comment there and start chatting through there. Otherwise, I&amp;rsquo;m also on Twitter. Much more active in Twitter. Can just DM me at any moment and we can chat from there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Awesome. And I also have the links in the description below of this video on YouTube. You can see Bianca&amp;rsquo;s YouTube channel there, but also, I don&amp;rsquo;t know why you didn&amp;rsquo;t even mention it. But you also have now, it&amp;rsquo;s not a course anymore, it&amp;rsquo;s a community, right? It&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;a href=&#34;https://biancapereira.gumroad.com/l/prolific-researcher-community&#34;&gt;Prolific Researcher Community&lt;/a&gt;. Can you just talk a little bit about that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Yeah, the main idea that I changed from course to a community is that many times we take a course and we say, &amp;ldquo;Wow, I learned a lot.&amp;rdquo; But then it comes a moment to put everything to practice. And I was like, &amp;ldquo;Okay, I&amp;rsquo;m stuck, so how can I get help?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the idea of the community that you, you come, you have an onboarding course where you learn how to take notes, how to express your thoughts, how to create a idea notes. And then, later in the second follow up course that you can take immediately or a little bit later. Because when you come to the community, come for a few months.
Now that I have my notes, how can I create new ideas from those notes and use and write my output base on my notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are the course, the onboarding course and the follow up course, and there are a few others coming up, but there is also events or co-working sessions, Q&amp;amp;As, hot seat coaching, many other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s like, okay, you heard from me, now it&amp;rsquo;s time to develop your own practice. So then as you develop your own practice, then you get feedback, then you get support from me and from the community. And that&amp;rsquo;s why I change from a course into more community model because I think the one important aspect, okay, it needs to be something that works for you. That&amp;rsquo;s why I say it needs to be for each person. And we are there to support each one to decide which tool I want to use, how do I want to implement that? What works for my specific case and what doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for my specific case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s the idea of the prolific researcher community. And we have also course about research skills specifically. They&amp;rsquo;re related to the process of idea management or note making, but we have other things related to research specifically as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: All right. Thank you, Bianca. I&amp;rsquo;m so happy to finally have you on my channel. We&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about it for a while. You&amp;rsquo;re welcome back anytime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Thanks a lot for invitation. I I really enjoyed talking to you and thanks for everyone also who join us today. And I hope to be back and I hope to have you my channel at some point as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Yeah, absolutely. I&amp;rsquo;m game, just tell me when and where.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For everybody else, thank you for sticking around. Later this Friday, &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtube.com/live/8IyaSGI8X8Q&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m having another livestream&lt;/a&gt;. This time, we&amp;rsquo;re going to be talking about something less serious than the topic of today&amp;rsquo;s discussion &amp;lsquo;cause we&amp;rsquo;re talking about all play, we are talking about role playing games. And I am going to be with my friend and dungeon master, &lt;a href=&#34;https://polaine.com&#34;&gt;Andy Polaine&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re going be comparing how he takes notes and how I take notes on the same sessions, on the same campaign. So that should be interesting as well. Thank you, everyone for joining us and I&amp;rsquo;ll see you on Friday. Bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIANCA: Bye-Bye.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Obsidian Dice Roller plugin lets you use randomness in Obsidian to provoke serendipity in personal knowledge management. Dice Roller is a plugin that was created for use in tabletop roleplaying games, but you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a gamer to be able to use it to spark creativity in your thinking for other topics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Future of Obsidian with CEO Stephan Ango and Andy Polaine</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20230312-future-of-obsidian/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2023 00:27:40 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20230312-future-of-obsidian/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is the future of Obsidian? The new Obsidian CEO, Stephan Ango (@kepano), talks about why he joined the Obsidian team and what he wants to do next. I&amp;rsquo;m Nicole van der Hoeven, and today I&amp;rsquo;m joined by my friend, Andy Polaine, to find out what&amp;rsquo;s on the horizon for our favourite note-taking app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TkNTuFF2t-c&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;key-takeaways&#34;&gt;Key takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10 notable points raised in the video were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stephan thinks the proliferation of tools for thought is a positive thing, in that every new tool that uses Markdown makes the standard more futureproof.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s three major pillars are extensibility, privacy, and longevity. Those are things Obsidian excels at.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The things Obsidian is bad at are the consequences of those three major pillars (such as fragmentation, difficulty in sharing, and being restricted to Markdown).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Obsidian team consists of five full-time people, including founders Licat (Shida, dev) and Silver (Erica, product), Liam (dev of Calendar plugin), and Joethei (plugin reviews and dev ecosystem).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upcoming features: better metadata format than YAML (think something like Dataview inline fields), better querying of tasks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stephan wants to keep the Obsidian team small, and grow only when absolutely necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to get exact usage figures for Obsidian, but going by downloads of the app bundle, there are about 1 million users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Obsidian team doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to bring on venture capital investors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better sharing in Obsidian is something they&amp;rsquo;re thinking about, but they need to prioritize use cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artificial intelligence in Obsidian is likely to remain in the realm of community plugins for now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is a transcript of the video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;introductions-nicole-van-der-hoeven-stephan-ango-andy-polaine&#34;&gt;Introductions: Nicole van der Hoeven, Stephan Ango, Andy Polaine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Hello, everyone. I&amp;rsquo;m Nicole van der Hoeven, and today I&amp;rsquo;m joined by two special guests. And I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce first, I guess, Stephan Ango, or you might know him better as Kepano.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Hey, Nicole. Thank you for having me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: You&amp;rsquo;re welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Kepano&amp;rsquo;s great. You can call me Kepano. I&amp;rsquo;m fine with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: So, Stephan is a designer and an engineer, and most recently, he was announced to be the CEO of Obsidian. So that&amp;rsquo;s going to be interesting. I actually know you more for the stuff that you&amp;rsquo;ve made for Obsidian, like Minimal, and also Hider and Web Clipper. But it looks like you&amp;rsquo;ve been in the industry for a while making, I&amp;rsquo;d say similar tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah. Well, I mean, up until now it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really in the consumer space. I was building startups in more in the B2B area, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a lot of these tools for a long time. So, as a user, I&amp;rsquo;m older than I look, I guess. I&amp;rsquo;ve been like, building, I think the first thing that I really got into when I was a teenager was Winamp Skins. And so like, this is like, &amp;rsquo;90s, early 2000s, making my first website and things around that time. So that&amp;rsquo;s how, that was my first, I guess, experience, like, building things in the software world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Awesome. And also here to help me interview you basically, is Andy Polaine, who is a lot of things. Designer, educator, writer, design leadership coach. He&amp;rsquo;s also co-authored a book called, &amp;ldquo;Service Design: From Insight to Implementation.&amp;rdquo; And he has a podcast called, &amp;ldquo;Power of Ten.&amp;rdquo; But really, the most important thing is he&amp;rsquo;s my Dungeon Master. We play D&amp;amp;D every week, and he&amp;rsquo;s also a good friend. We actually met because of Obsidian. So, welcome to the channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Thanks. Thanks for having me on. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to be a co-host. Or co-interviewer. Co-interviewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s really weird for me to not take cues from you and roll dice when you tell me to, but, you know, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how that goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I&amp;rsquo;ve got the dice here just in case we need-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Okay, well I&amp;rsquo;ve got mine too, so. Anytime you need me to roll a save, I&amp;rsquo;m ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Well, let&amp;rsquo;s just roll for initiative to see who interviews first, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Yeah. Okay, let&amp;rsquo;s do that. Rollies, what are you going to roll? Okay. Just a d20. I rolled a two, so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I got an 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: You go first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pkm-history-and-getting-started-with-obsidian&#34;&gt;PKM history and getting started with Obsidian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Okay, all right. I will, so, really, the first question for you is, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of under a sort of batch of questions really, about why Obsidian, but how did you get started with Obsidian?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: First, can you give me any like, buffs or stats or anything as my character would?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Well, I think you get sort of plus one in design and coding, right? So, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: What class do you think Stephan would be, Andy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Wizard, I reckon. Or an arcanist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Yeah, I was thinking like-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: No, I reckon-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Sorcerer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Yeah, or a, you know, someone who kind of makes stuff as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Artificer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Artificer, yeah. That&amp;rsquo;s what I reckon he is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Back in the World of Warcraft days-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: So high end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: I played a lot of the paladin class. I like the hybrid class, but I think that I also in like, &amp;ldquo;Lord of the Rings&amp;rdquo; really love, you know, Gandalf and those types of guy, Radagast, you know. I&amp;rsquo;m definitely into those types of characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Someone who can produce something out of nothing. So. So. As you were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: I forgot what your question was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Yes, so we&amp;rsquo;re going to lose half the audience straightaway. So, you know, you were a customer, right? You were a user before you became CEO and pretty quickly I seem to remember seeing your, certainly your theme, I think, probably a couple of other things, seeing you in the Obsidian Discord. So, you know, what was your hook into Obsidian in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: We&amp;rsquo;re getting some comments that your mic is very crackly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: We are hearing it. This is weird, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I had it before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Some people are hearing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s going on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: But to answer your question, I had been using the, over the past like, 15 or so years, I&amp;rsquo;ve used a lot of different tools to kind of try to solve what for me was mostly a journaling question. So, I wanted to be able to just write kind of, my own diary notes in a tool that, over time I discovered that the Wiki type of format was what I really loved. I kind of fell in love with the wiki link kind of idea. And that idea&amp;rsquo;s been around, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure exactly who invented the notation. I think it was the Wikipedia people in the MediaWiki, the kind of like, double-bracket concept. But once I discovered that, I felt that I only wanted to use like, journaling with that. So the one that I used for a long time was TiddlyWiki, and TiddlyWiki has that same kind of bracket notation, but I found that my personal sensibilities as a user, I really wanted something that felt like, very simple and minimalistic. Like, as you may notice from the kind of like, type of themes and things that I&amp;rsquo;ve made for Obsidian. And when Obsidian came out, I found out about it almost right away, like, in, I guess April, 2020, you know, as right as the pandemic was kicking off. Like, I think a lot of people, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, around that time were staying at home, were exploring different things and I found out about it, I had spent probably a year trying to kind of customize TiddlyWiki to be a little bit more user friendly, and Obsidian, even in like, V1 or whatever, not V1, it was like, V0.001, was already better than what TiddlyWiki was doing for me in terms of, it had the quick switcher, it had the prompts, it had the file Nav in the way that I wanted. It didn&amp;rsquo;t quite look like what I wanted, but it had a lot of the kind of, nice user interface patterns that I was looking for. And so I pretty much started making, I took, I was looking back at my notes, kind of preparing for this conversation, and I pretty much went all in on Obsidian after using it just for a couple days. I imported everything, and started making the minimal theme like, immediately. But I was just making it for myself at first. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t intending to publish it, I just kind of made it to solve my own UI preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: So I actually used TiddlyWiki quite a bit. The reason that I used it was a lot of, &amp;lsquo;cause I was a consultant at the time, and a lot of the tools that were out there required, like, they were basically on the cloud so it was a SaaS platform that I&amp;rsquo;d have to log into and not, and those sites weren&amp;rsquo;t always allowed by whatever company I happened to be working for, so that&amp;rsquo;s what I loved about TiddlyWiki, that it could just sit on like, a flash drive and it would work. And that&amp;rsquo;s part of the reason that I started using Obsidian too, is &amp;lsquo;cause it&amp;rsquo;s local.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah. Yeah, and that was something, you know, being able to use it on your computer when you&amp;rsquo;re offline, just having that control. I was, you know, using it on flights, and so that local first idea to me is, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I just find it much more natural and it allows you to do things so much faster. And because I have experience, you know, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say that like, being an engineer is first and foremost what I do, but I do dabble in a lot of different things on the code side and using, I use Sublime Text as my main code editor, but having, being used to using like, a code editor, you just expect everything to be there for you, right away, super fast. Like, even a small delay feels like it gets in the way of my productivity in some cases. So, being in the cloud, it always feels a little slow. And I&amp;rsquo;ve used a lot of those tools in my previous, especially for work purposes like Confluence or Google Docs or those things. And the sluggishness I feel like, really gets in the way of being able to make progress on whatever you&amp;rsquo;re trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Yeah. I mean for me, it was the portability thing. I switched to Markdown for everything, I think, for my blog. Like really, really soon after Gruber kind of released it. And I used to use Notational Velocity, which I think it was probably one of the first ones I know of, of a kind of this idea of a database that just sits on top of a bunch of Markdown files. And then Brett Terpstra was putting together NvALT, and nvUltra, which he&amp;rsquo;s still working on. And you know, I&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty disloyal. I&amp;rsquo;ve used lots and lots of like, every and probably most people, every Markdown out there. And a lot of them are starting to do the kind of wiki thing too, but depending-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: And there&amp;rsquo;s so many of them and-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Yeah. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: And I think that is such a great thing that now that the ecosystem of Markdown editing tools is so deep and broad, that I often think that Obsidian, to me what&amp;rsquo;s exciting about this whole kind of area is like, I&amp;rsquo;m very curious about how we can make digital information persist over a long period of time. Like, how will the ideas that we have right now continue to persist for hundreds of years in the future? We&amp;rsquo;ve had books for thousands of years, but we&amp;rsquo;ve only had digital files for, you know, 70 or 80 years. And I like the idea that something like, plain text could still be around for the next few hundred years. And so using something like Markdown is, like, the file in a way is way more important than the apps. Like, Obsidian will eventually become obsolete because technology changes so much. But hopefully, the plain text will continue to live forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Yeah. I mean a bit like you, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna ask you about Computer Show actually later, but a bit like you, I&amp;rsquo;ve been around for quite a long time and I thought, I&amp;rsquo;ve been in digital stuff for like, 30-something years and I got fed up, but one of the reasons I moved to doing everything, I do all that, still do my invoicing, you know, with Markdown and stuff because I had so many times where like, &amp;ldquo;Oh the app&amp;rsquo;s gone out of, you know, out of production,&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve got so much of my work still on like, CD-ROMs.&amp;rdquo; I keep an old laptop that&amp;rsquo;s still got a CD-ROM drive, just in order to be able to view that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Oh, really? You&amp;rsquo;ve got to transfer those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: It still runs, kinda like, oh, it&amp;rsquo;s a, no, but yeah, but some of it&amp;rsquo;s like, Director MacroMind, actually, Macromedia Director stuff, that that&amp;rsquo;s the only thing you can play on, so you sort of have to keep the machine for it, too. And I transferred a lot of other stuff, but I had the same thing and I started using Evernote once and then trying getting stuff out. It was horrendous. Had the same thing with Notions, of exporting out of Notion, and it kind of dumps all this other crap in there. And so, you know, yeah, I agree. I think the file format is the kind of winner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah, the file is more important than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dealing-with-competitors&#34;&gt;Dealing with competitors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I&amp;rsquo;m interested though more as CEO, that you&amp;rsquo;ve got, you know, there are a whole lot of, well, I kind of would perhaps a little bit rudely say Obsidian clones kind of popping up. It feels like, in the last, you know, even in the last year there&amp;rsquo;s been a lot of stuff coming up. So, you know, whether you perceive those, is that a challenge for Obsidian? Is Obsidian kind of, just take its own path that each of them have their kind of own flavors? Now is it a good thing, you see it as a good thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Well, I see it as a good thing because I am still kind of like, a plain text maximalist. So I think that you have to have a diversity of clients in order for that to kind of last forever. Like, I still think the file is more important than the app. I do think that where it gets dangerous is if there&amp;rsquo;s too many app-specific syntaxes that start to emerge. I think that is kind of dangerous because it reduces interoperability. Like, I think that, you know, Markdown, for all its flaws, and I think a lot of people have frustrations with Markdown, it has kind of stood the test of time, at least for the past, however many, 12, 15 years it&amp;rsquo;s been around, I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure, but maybe more at this point, I&amp;rsquo;m getting old. And so, I think that that is one of the biggest challenges that we have with Obsidian is sometimes we wanna do something new. Like, recently we launched the Canvas feature and there isn&amp;rsquo;t a, you know, off-the-shelf kind of canvas type of bio format. So we, you know, created a new one that is, you know, open and the type specification for it is out there, but there&amp;rsquo;s no other client for that file format yet. Hopefully there will be, but I think that that diversity of clients is good because there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of people who have lots of different ideas about how thinking should work, and Obsidian is not particularly dogmatic, like, a big part of, you know, one of the main values that we always think about is extensibility. So how do we make it easy for individual users to customize Obsidian? And also, how do we enable developers to build on top of it? But there&amp;rsquo;s a, I think it&amp;rsquo;s very viable to create a very opinionated Markdown or tool, you know, editing tool that takes a different approach than Obsidian. And I&amp;rsquo;ve seen many people who enjoy using more than one, different one for different parts of their workflow. So yeah, I think it&amp;rsquo;s good. I think we&amp;rsquo;re living through a little bit of like, this Cambrian explosion moment because for some reason right now, in the past couple of years, like, people have realized this a really exciting problem to work on and I think we all learn a lot from each other, so, I see it as a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: So one of the things that you said, &amp;lsquo;cause I trolled through your blog while I was thinking of questions for this. You had a post about how great tools choose to be bad at some things. So, what do you think Obsidian has chosen to be bad at?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Well, I think that design principles are only real design principles if you can take both sides of it and create something compelling. Like, for example, we talked about extensibility. That&amp;rsquo;s one of our, I would say there&amp;rsquo;s like, three major pillars to what Obsidian is trying to be. One of them is around privacy, one of them is around longevity of your notes, and one of them is around extensibility. So those three things are the things that we want to continue being really good at. But you can take the extensibility example as kind of one of our design principles. We wanna make Obsidian super extensible. But you could, I can see why some people would prefer an app that&amp;rsquo;s not at all extensible, that is, you know, completely designed by one small group of people who are trying to make a very cohesive experience. I think one of the big challenges with Obsidian is we&amp;rsquo;re always asking ourselves, &amp;ldquo;What should be a community plugin versus a core plugin?&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;re always asking ourselves, &amp;ldquo;How can we make community plugins feel more native to the app and more cohesive and intuitive to people? Do they make sense with the rest of the app? Because any developer can basically build anything inside of Obsidian. And so it, I think it is a common point of frustration for some new Obsidian users that they have to download a lot of plugins and some of them feel a little janky. So, you know, Obsidian has chosen to be bad at that, with the trade off that it allows a lot of freedom for people to customize the app. And you can take the same example with, you know, privacy and longevity. Those have their own trade offs as well. Andy, did you wanna say something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I was thinking, you know, it reminded me of what you just said. It was just as you talked about the plugin thing. One of the tricks that Apple did with the iPhone, was to make the phone bit an app. And it sounds just like, a really banal thing, but up until then there were phones, smartphones, were kind of phones with sort of app bits in them, and they were really janky. And I think one of the things also, obviously not having a keyboard, having a touch screen, means that that thing where you get whatever app you&amp;rsquo;re in is completely the app. All right? So, you know, I&amp;rsquo;m in FaceTime, it&amp;rsquo;s completely FaceTime, I&amp;rsquo;m in Obsidian and it&amp;rsquo;s completely Obsidian, the whole phone turns into whatever app you&amp;rsquo;re in. And I feel that, you know, in a way that&amp;rsquo;s what the plugin mechanism can do for Obsidian. At its base it&amp;rsquo;s, you know, it&amp;rsquo;s a text editor that&amp;rsquo;s browsing as a viewer on a set of Markdown files. But you know, as soon as you start putting, particularly some of the more powerful plugins in it, it becomes something completely else. And I think, I find it really kind of powerful that you can switch that stuff on and off. I can see that the, you know, I was sharing my students the other day &amp;lsquo;cause they were talking about design research and how you can use Obsidian, and quite a lot of them use Notion. And I can completely see why they use Notion, right? &amp;lsquo;Cause it&amp;rsquo;s just, you know, zero learning curve for them. Until such time as they want to take that stuff with them, and then they&amp;rsquo;ll find out. And I think some of that stuff&amp;rsquo;s a bit like doing backups. You find out the hard way, right? But I kind of feel like that is a, it&amp;rsquo;s been a smart trade off to make with Obsidian, with the plugins. And I was just wondering at this point-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: But it has its downsides. I mean, I think the point, you know, on privacy, the way we think about that is that is having ownership over your files. They&amp;rsquo;re not in somebody else&amp;rsquo;s database. They&amp;rsquo;re on your computer, on your device. You know, if you choose to use the first-party sync, everything&amp;rsquo;s end-to-end encrypted, and so we have this kind of strong pillar around privacy, but it has the trade off that it makes certain things harder for us. For example, people ask us, would we ever see a web client for Obsidian? A like, online, you know, cloud-based Obsidian? And that&amp;rsquo;s a lot harder for us to do because we don&amp;rsquo;t have access to your files. We would have to compromise on that value of encrypting your data and kind of being able to see that information on our side in order to be able to present it back to you. And that makes things really tough. Unless, there&amp;rsquo;s some, we&amp;rsquo;ve thought about this question a lot, but it really is a very hard problem to solve. But for someone who, you know, for whatever scenario they might be in, either can&amp;rsquo;t access a local app because they, you know, there were computer restricts, you know, apps and they can&amp;rsquo;t download Obsidian or they&amp;rsquo;re on a school computer and they have to access it from the school computer, it does present a limitation. But I think strong principles force those kinds of trade-offs where you could take either side and make a compelling and legitimate app. We just, you know, have chosen our own particular set of trade off and that&amp;rsquo;s what that blog post was about. So. So there&amp;rsquo;s other things that Obsidian is bad at as well, like, relating to longevity and like, the choice of using Markdown, for example. It&amp;rsquo;s not the most intuitive to some people. I can come up with a long list of things that Obsidian is bad at, in favor of something that it wants to be really good at. And I think that&amp;rsquo;s a, making trade offs is our job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Well, one of the things that I hear a lot is that Obsidian is too developer focused, or some people think it&amp;rsquo;s not approachable. And I think it comes back to what we&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about. You do have to make a decision, you do sacrifice a little bit of usability in exchange for flexibility and modularity. My background is in performance engineering, so I care a lot about performance and I love this idea of making the most streamlined possible app, and then just leaving room for extensions so that other people can make their own decisions. I would rather have that, than have an app that has everything baked in and I have really no choice as to what to turn on or off because my use case is going to be different from everybody else&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: That&amp;rsquo;s Microsoft Word, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: When you just have the sort of, bloat and they get those screenshots, sometimes, of every palette open and there&amp;rsquo;s about this much space, they actually edit some text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: By the way, do you like my shirt?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Oh yes. Classic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Where&amp;rsquo;s yours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: How disappointing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: I know, I haven&amp;rsquo;t, I&amp;rsquo;m such a minimalist-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: It&amp;rsquo;s a print.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten my Obsidian merch yet, but, yeah, you&amp;rsquo;re looking good over there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: So, you know, you&amp;rsquo;ve been contributing to Obsidian, pretty much from the get go, and then you started working with them. What is it with them? It&amp;rsquo;s the, the Licat and Silver, basically-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: It&amp;rsquo;s the smart, yeah, the smart team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;joining-the-obsidian-team&#34;&gt;Joining the Obsidian team&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Two-person team. So, you know, how did that, I don&amp;rsquo;t know how much you can reveal, how did that come about and then, and what was the sort of transition? When was there this kind of moment of like, &amp;ldquo;Hey, how about becoming CEO?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah, well, it was a very organic process because I, you know, was running a different company at the time when Obsidian first came out. And so, I had, you know, started building minimal theme, a bunch of different small plugins here and there, the Web Clipper. And I was a very vocal in the Discord and forum about some of the things that I thought would be, you know, improvements or bug fixes. And at the time, the Obsidian community was way smaller than it is today. And so, I was often interacting with Licat and Silver, the founders of Obsidian, through the Discord. And just kind of, just talking very organically about here are some things that could be improved, here are some, you know, bugs I found. Can you help me with this feature of Minimal that I am trying to, you know, build into my plugin? Can you give me some feedback on how to do this properly? And so, we started interacting, you know, talking about Obsidian for a couple of years. And, I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure at what point it started, and maybe it was around the time that, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to like, actually remember, but I think there was like, a Gems of the Year contest where Minimal won like, the Best Theme category, and I think I started DMing more with Silver and Licat around that time, and just kind of getting to know them just over chat in Discord. And they found out that I had been, you know, running some startups and asked me for some advice on a couple small things here and there. And so we just kind of kept that conversation going, and at some point last year, there was this kind of idea that Obsidian wanted to kinda reach the 1.0 release. And the 1.0 release, I mean I think it, you know, it&amp;rsquo;s funny that it, it was really a milestone moment, because we, that&amp;rsquo;s when I started becoming involved in the project and they asked me to basically create the new default theme. And so I was working with them part-time, kind of taking a lot of my experience on Minimal and bringing that into the core app. But also, they were asking me about some of the things that I felt were on my like, top priority list of small details that we felt were still kind of embarrassing or like, wanted to really get nailed down before we could really feel like we could call it a 1.0. And, that&amp;rsquo;s when I started working much more closely with them, as well as Liam, who is now a full-time part of the team. You might know Liam from the calendar plugin. He&amp;rsquo;s amazing. We have basically five people full-time. Joethei, you might have seen around the community who helps a lot with plugin reviews and the developer ecosystem, and then a few other folks who&amp;rsquo;ve been helping us part-time, like MG Meyers, who you might know from the Kanban plugin and style settings is working on, has been working on Canvas and kind of like, led the Canvas effort. And so, the more conversations kept going on with this project, I just realized it was so much fun and I love Obsidian so much. Like I just, I really want it to continue to be an important tool in my life, in a very selfish way, but also I think that Shida and Erica, Licat and Silver, are such mature like, entrepreneurs, they&amp;rsquo;re quite a bit younger than me. They make me feel old all the time. But it&amp;rsquo;s a great exchange of knowledge and yeah, so we started discussing this idea and they were on board. I think it&amp;rsquo;s a very, we have very complimentary skills. I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about, like, Licat&amp;rsquo;s one of the most incredible engineers that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever worked with. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with a lot of like, amazing engineers throughout my life and I have like, so much respect for him. He&amp;rsquo;s just super, super impressive and continues to be like, they&amp;rsquo;re both gonna continue to be involved for the foreseeable future. And Erica has just an incredible mind for, you know, product and how to think about what users really care about. And so, and has been, I think, the person who&amp;rsquo;s, in a way, influenced why Obsidian has such an amazing community more than anybody else. Just kind of from the beginning, making that an important part of Obsidian, I think is a lot of credit to Erica. So, seeing, like, getting to know them just made me realize like, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing that I would rather do than help that community continue to grow, help make sure that Obsidian has the, kind of like, structure that it can last for a long time, kind of going back to that principle of longevity that matters at the app level. How do we actually make that viable at the company level so that the kind of, product and the company can be aligned? So yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s why I kind of believe that-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: I also just wanted to call out-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Very organic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole There&amp;rsquo;s some people who are asking-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Oh, where do we get the merchandise?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Where do we get the merch? By the way, I bought this. And it is here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Just so everybody can see, &amp;lsquo;cause there&amp;rsquo;s some awesome things on there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah, I think it&amp;rsquo;s-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: I want I wanted to ask you-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-intentional-tools-for-tool-builders&#34;&gt;Building intentional tools for tool builders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Yeah, it is. So I wanted to also ask you, earlier when I was introducing you, I said that you have worked in similar spaces, which I realize now is a bit odd because the companies that you had worked on before aren&amp;rsquo;t note-taking apps. But what I meant by that, is actually I&amp;rsquo;m seeing a theme in what you&amp;rsquo;ve worked on and it&amp;rsquo;s all about creating things that are minimal, intentional, well-made. And I think like, in your previous company, Lumi, you were talking about packaging, and making that a little bit more transparent and intentional as well. I know you&amp;rsquo;re also an industrial designer, or you claim not to be one anymore, but that&amp;rsquo;s also something that permeates your work there as well, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m a generalist. I like to dabble in a lot of different things. And so, it has taken me in a lot of different directions, but I think the common theme is I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in making tools. So everything basically in my professional career has been a tool of some kind. So in the case of Lumi, it was a tool, it was actually two different tools. One was for factories, to help manufacturers kind of bring their capabilities online, and a tool that helped businesses who need to collaborate with manufacturers, find the right manufacturers and work with them. And so, I like building tools that kind of empower individuals to do something that they couldn&amp;rsquo;t do before. And so Obsidian definitely fits into that because I feel like, I mean, in my own personal life, it&amp;rsquo;s been so rewarding and exciting to use Obsidian. Like, I feel like, my thought process is clear and more reliable when I&amp;rsquo;m using Obsidian. And I feel like, that&amp;rsquo;s such an exciting superpower that I have that I want to help more people get that feeling, too. So yeah, like, throughout my life basically like, that theme just keeps coming back of like, making tools that help other people do whatever they&amp;rsquo;re trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: And it&amp;rsquo;s also helping other people make other things, right? &amp;lsquo;Cause like, you know, you&amp;rsquo;ve also worked on things like, that kind of pare down what is out there, because there&amp;rsquo;s an information overload that&amp;rsquo;s out there and I know you&amp;rsquo;ve made like, Tidy, which kind of streamlines what we even see on the page. What do you think, is there anything in Obsidian, &amp;lsquo;cause we&amp;rsquo;ve talked about things that it&amp;rsquo;s bad at. Are there any big features that you&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce to it, that don&amp;rsquo;t detract from, that don&amp;rsquo;t make it like this bloated bit of software but still are along the same lines of being intentional and helping people?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Definitely. I think that the area we want to keep working on is the primitives. Like, what are the basic things that you can use that you can build on top of? So, we have a public roadmap that&amp;rsquo;s not always the most up to date, but one of the big things we&amp;rsquo;re working on right now is around metadata. So, a lot of, I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan in my personal use, of DataView is one of my favorite plugins for Obsidian, and I use it for everything. And kind of asking ourselves like, &amp;ldquo;What can we do that would enable the user and developer ecosystem of Obsidian to leverage metadata even more?&amp;rdquo; So, you know, you can, there&amp;rsquo;s a couple different ways that you can add metadata to your notes with Obsidian. One of them is through YAML in the frontmatter, and one of them is through DataView has these like, custom fields. So that&amp;rsquo;s an area that, we want to, like, the author of DataView had to create this new notation with the double colon. You know, you put a key in a value and separate them with a double colon, and that notation was essentially invented by the author of DataView because it&amp;rsquo;s so painful to write YAML. And so, what can we do to clean that up a little bit and make metadata feel more like a first-class citizen from the user&amp;rsquo;s perspective, but also enable more developers to build on top of that. Yeah, API docs and developer portal. I&amp;rsquo;m looking, I can&amp;rsquo;t even remember what we have on here. Tasks. There&amp;rsquo;s a few other things that we have up our sleeve at the moment, that I&amp;rsquo;ll be excited to share in a little bit. Talking about the roadmap-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: A few questions, Stephan-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah, go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: You mentioned DataView. I know that he&amp;rsquo;s working on DataCore, right? Is that going to be something that&amp;rsquo;s going to be built into Obsidian or is it still going to be a community plugin? Honestly, I would never use Obsidian without DataView.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: You know, I haven&amp;rsquo;t really, I&amp;rsquo;m not exactly sure what the goals of DataCore are. I&amp;rsquo;m not super informed about what he&amp;rsquo;s trying to do with that. I think that our job is always to find the right balance between what feels like a core plugin, what feels like it should be part of the community. And so, I think that long term we do wanna have good ways for people to add metadata to their notes and perhaps view kind of an output of that in some way. I think that&amp;rsquo;s kind of a long-term project, but in the short term, the metadata improvements is really about making it a lot easier to add metadata to your notes and then hopefully that makes things like DataView easier to use. But maybe long term will consider some more ways that people can like, look and view their data, or the metadata from their notes. I do found that DataView, one challenge with it is it is pretty nerdy. Like, it does require, it has a syntax that&amp;rsquo;s a little bit, you know, like, SQL and I think that that&amp;rsquo;s not the most user friendly. So we&amp;rsquo;ve seen quite a few plugins pop up, like DB Folder is one that&amp;rsquo;s kind of interesting that makes it a little bit more WYSIWYG. And that&amp;rsquo;s one of the big benefits that we have as a community is that people can build plugins that optimize for different types of users. People who love writing SQL, they&amp;rsquo;re gonna love using DataView, but people who prefer something more WYSIWYG are gonna prefer a different type of UI. And we can be patient in our approach to what we actually wanna build into the core because we could just kind of watch what people like, what people make, and decide later down the road what we wanna build ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;growth-of-obsidian-as-a-team-and-company&#34;&gt;Growth of Obsidian as a team and company&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Do you think there are, I mean are there any plans to then grow the team? Or is partly what makes it special, the fact that you are a very small team?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: I think that for now we wanna stay really small. We wanna be as small as we can be because, you know, one of the other things that&amp;rsquo;s really important that made me want to join Obsidian, is that from an early stage, Shida and Erica decided that they didn&amp;rsquo;t wanna bring on investors, like, venture capital investors. And I have, throughout my career, worked and built companies that have used every single funding model under the sun. Like, my first company was one of the very first Kickstarter campaigns ever, back in 2009. I&amp;rsquo;ve gone down the venture capital route, I&amp;rsquo;ve done bootstrapping, like, I&amp;rsquo;ve tried it all. And I think when it comes to the goals of Obsidian that we&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about, like, longevity in particular comes to mind, but also privacy and extensibility, I find that is not very compatible with the VC route. And, you know, if you just kind of survey the ecosystem, you&amp;rsquo;ll find that actually, almost all of the kind of big PKM apps, if you wanna call them that, have raised a lot of money, like, millions of dollars from, or hundreds of millions of dollars, even. And the problem with that is that, I think it&amp;rsquo;s misaligning the incentives in the long term for, you know, the user and how they want to kind of, store their notes. Like, basically it incentivizes certain behaviors that are kind of against our principles. And so for that reason, we&amp;rsquo;re trying to build very intentionally and also work through the extensibility part of our like, principle to enable the community to customize things more. Like, we don&amp;rsquo;t feel like it&amp;rsquo;s necessarily our job to make this like, huge app that has every single feature. We like seeing how the community kind of extends Obsidian in their own ways. So I would say that growing the team, it will be more by necessity than by a desire to like, try to do everything ourselves. We&amp;rsquo;re getting to a point now where, I would guess, we don&amp;rsquo;t actually even know how many Obsidian users there are because we&amp;rsquo;re so focused on privacy, we don&amp;rsquo;t have analytics, we just like, don&amp;rsquo;t know. But we can guess based on a few different like, things like, how many people downloaded the app bundle, that there&amp;rsquo;s probably close to a million users of Obsidian and only basically five core members of the team. And eventually, from a support standpoint are things, things might start to break and we might need to hire people to help on that front. But we&amp;rsquo;re trying to stay small if we can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Yeah. I think you&amp;rsquo;ve been very diplomatic about the VC thing. I mean, in general it&amp;rsquo;s, you know, you&amp;rsquo;ve got, in my coaching practice, and I coach a lot of design leaders who are kind of suffering in startups or scale ups because of this constant pressure to scale, because this constant pressure for just more and you know, I want a 10 X on my, you know, investors want 10 X return on their investment in some stupid amount of time, things like that. And it definitely leads to that, you know, what Cory, Dr. Al calls sort of, an end certification, you know, this thing where then there&amp;rsquo;s a choke point and we have everyone&amp;rsquo;s data on our server and they have to use app and then you just start, it becomes a sort of process of trying to extract value. And I-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve touched on the thing-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Oh, go on, go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: To defend VC, I will say there&amp;rsquo;s some businesses where, it kind of is necessary because especially, we&amp;rsquo;re in a privileged position, building software, because software has no cost to us. But there&amp;rsquo;s some companies, you know, that have to produce a physical product in the world-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan:: And they have to buy the materials and put in orders and so they need to raise money somehow, and VC is one of those paths. You can get loans, like, there&amp;rsquo;s different ways. So I think it, I&amp;rsquo;m not like, I just have a kind of, like, a more zen point of view on that where like, I understand why a lot of companies go that direction and it makes sense. I think in the case of what we&amp;rsquo;re trying to build specifically, it&amp;rsquo;s a bad fit. But it&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily a bad fit for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: So-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: You mentioned anything just now which is, oh sorry, Nicole. What were you gonna say?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sharing-obsidian-sync-obsidian-publish&#34;&gt;Sharing, Obsidian Sync, Obsidian Publish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: I was gonna say I&amp;rsquo;d like to go back to, and just quickly, to what Obsidian is bad at. And you know, Stephan, I love Obsidian. It is, I&amp;rsquo;m all for it. I am possibly the biggest fan. I think one thing that Obsidian is bad at that I really would love to see improved, is sharing. Because I think that is the thing that stops most people from using it, because, you know, using it on your own in an isolated way is one thing. It excels at that. But anytime that you have other people that you wanna do that with, as an example, Andy and I play D&amp;amp;D. Okay, this not a work thing, right? But it is a recreational use, and honestly, it takes up a lot of, my usage of Obsidian is role playing games. And in that group, there are four of us, three and a half, who use Obsidian. We can&amp;rsquo;t share our notes. We can&amp;rsquo;t have like, one repository for all of us to collaborate on. So we have like, individual notes, and yes, we could use something like Dropbox to share those notes, but then Andy for example, can&amp;rsquo;t, or wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to share all of his notes with us. Maybe some of them he would. So I would love to see like, a little bit more permissions around sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah, I think sharing is a big, like, it&amp;rsquo;s a challenge because there&amp;rsquo;s like, three or four different use cases nested under sharing that are quite different from one another. So, we have published, so we&amp;rsquo;re doing a lot of work right now, actually, on making some publish improvements. There&amp;rsquo;s a big batch of publish improvements that just went live like, a week or two ago, and that&amp;rsquo;s more about sharing to the external world, an entire vault, and we wanna keep improving that. Then there is sync, which is like, has this concept called Shared Vaults. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if you&amp;rsquo;ve tried that out, but Sync Shared Vaults is actually what we use internally on the Obsidian team. So everyone who&amp;rsquo;s like, you know, between the five of us, are working on projects, we keep our notes in one shared vault. Then there&amp;rsquo;s also the idea of, &amp;ldquo;Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m writing this note, I just wanna send a link to someone so that they can view it.&amp;rdquo; They don&amp;rsquo;t have Obsidian or they don&amp;rsquo;t know, you know, I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna like, put them through the process of having to, you know, learn everything about Obsidian just to read this one note. And that note might be, you know, semi-private, like, it&amp;rsquo;s like, something where it&amp;rsquo;s not like, a published use case where you want the world to see it, you just want this one person to see it. And then there&amp;rsquo;s a collaboration use case where like, Google Docs or Notion makes it really easy for a few people to be like, collaboratively editing something, even if they don&amp;rsquo;t, or have Obsidian, for example. So like, those are all kind of different problems to solve in different ways, and I do think that we want to find ways to solve those problems, figuring out what the right order, that&amp;rsquo;s another challenge about being a small team is like, what do we work on now versus later? But I think all of them are problems that we would like to solve, you know, over the kind of medium to long term for sure. We&amp;rsquo;re very aware of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: It feels like there&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a thread here, though, as well, when you&amp;rsquo;ve talked about, you know, &amp;lsquo;cause obviously the sharing bit brings up the privacy issue that you talked about before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Correct. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: And it also links to the, is there a browser-based version of Obsidian? You know, because one of the ways of obviously, easily sharing and collaborating on a document would be to have kind of a browser-based editor, even if it was just for that one document. And it&amp;rsquo;s almost like, you need a kind of, instead of a separate vault, a sort of enclave in your existing vault that you can say, &amp;ldquo;Oh this the shareable bit and all the rest of it, you know, remains encrypted,&amp;rdquo; let&amp;rsquo;s say, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if the encryption thing is an issue, but you know, at some point once you share it, you have to not do that, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: So I think-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: And that may be at the beginning of the browser-based version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: I think my problem is that I am able to do those use cases, but I use separate tools for each of them. I would really love to streamline in this area. Like you were talking about, being able to share a link. I use Etherpad with that, but it&amp;rsquo;s not the best. It works, though. And then when you talk about using Sync, I also subscribe to Sync, but that also requires other people to have Sync. So for those people who don&amp;rsquo;t use Obsidian enough to warrant Sync, I use Dropbox. And then at work, because we have all of our internal docs on GitHub repos, I use GitHub to bring my Obsidian notes and share them. And that brings a lot of things but also brings like, comments and being able to roll back changes, and, you know, handle merge conflicts, and that&amp;rsquo;s not something that Sync does as well for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: I totally agree. Yeah, I think that those are things that we have to eventually solve. And I do, going back to what feels like it should be a core thing and what feels like it should be a community thing, I think that sharing is something that belongs in core, or at least core needs to have good sharing mechanisms for all of the different use cases. Publishing, collaboration, single note sharing, is just a matter of, how do we do that? In what order do we build those features? And can we build them in a way that is consistent with our principles?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-management-in-obsidian&#34;&gt;Task management in Obsidian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Can we talk about task management? &amp;lsquo;Cause that was something that was on the roadmap. So is there anything you can share with us on that front?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Our goal around that one is fairly conservative, I would say. It&amp;rsquo;s not gonna be a major, you know, complete revamp to everything. It&amp;rsquo;s more about, how do we make tasks queriable in a better way, like, and also adding better date supports? So we&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about how do due dates work with tasks? So right now, there&amp;rsquo;s ways that you can do that with community plugins, but we wanna figure out, should there be a core way of dealing with due dates? Again, thinking about the API first and how that might, you know, enable developers to come up with some new experiences on top of that. But I would say that that project&amp;rsquo;s been a little bit on the back burner for us because, we had some other ideas that we wanted to prioritize first, like Canvas, and some of the things that we&amp;rsquo;re working on right now, like metadata and publish improvements, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: It does occur to me that a lot of these things, like task management, could be helped if you share a log something like DataCorp or DataView. &amp;lsquo;Cause the functionality is there, you just need to make it look pretty, but you&amp;rsquo;re good at that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah, I mean the challenge there is just again, like, you know, two, three people building things. We only have so much bandwidth and kind of finding that happy medium between, we wanna make sure that we&amp;rsquo;re, you know, releasing features at a good pace. But every time we add new capabilities, we also add, you know, add to the surface area of potential bugs of potential issues that might come up or edge cases with certain plugins, we increase the number of feature requests, like, when we add something like Canvas, then we get a whole bunch of new feature requests from people who are like, &amp;ldquo;Oh, Canvas is great, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do X, Y or Z.&amp;rdquo; So that, I don&amp;rsquo;t know that anyone has ever solved that problem. It&amp;rsquo;s just kind of a problem of building software in the world. But, that is probably the biggest challenge that we deal with as a team is like, how to find the right balance of what to build now, how comprehensive do we want this feature to be versus, you know, starting small and kind of building on top of it. But trail locking a plugin, we tend to, we&amp;rsquo;ve done it a couple times, and when we do, we tend to rewrite it from scratch pretty much. And so that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty big effort. Like, rewriting something like DataView or Data, I haven&amp;rsquo;t looked at the code for DataCore. It&amp;rsquo;s not a small task. It tends to be a pretty big thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;artificial-intelligence-in-obsidian&#34;&gt;Artificial intelligence in Obsidian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Another question here by Imaginationscene and another one by another user called Remy, &amp;ldquo;What about AI? Or integrating something like ChatGPT?&amp;rdquo; Is that something that&amp;rsquo;s on your radar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about this. I think that right now, so this kind of like, goes back to the benefit of the extensibility of Obsidian. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that Obsidian was the first app that had ChatGPT or like GPT-3 integrated into it, because someone in the community built a plugin for that called Text Generator. And now I think there&amp;rsquo;s three or four plug-ins out there that connect to the Open AI API. So, the cool thing for Obsidian is that because it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to build plug-ins, people tend to go really like, we both have the ability to be very fast and very slow, so, the community can go and build a plugin that solves that use case. And I think that they&amp;rsquo;re quite good, actually. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Text Generator a bunch, but we can also be patient about what&amp;rsquo;s the right way of building it for Obsidian. And I think that there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of companies right now rushing into adding GPT to everything. My personal preference when it comes to this, is I would like for it to all be local first, completely private. I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna send, you know, data that I don&amp;rsquo;t, like, I wanna have complete control over any data that is being sent. You know, there&amp;rsquo;s this concept of training and inference in, we&amp;rsquo;re getting like, right into the weeds of how AI works, but I would like, someday, to be able to have maybe a plugin, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a core plugin or a community plugin, that can do some training on your vault and kind of learn from your vault and be able to do the inference locally on your computer, so that it completely aligns with the principles of privacy and local first that Obsidian is known for. The challenge with that right now is that that&amp;rsquo;s quite intensive on the graphics card, and it&amp;rsquo;s quite complicated to set up locally for users, and we&amp;rsquo;re still kind of waiting to see whether a company like Stability, that they made stable diffusion and is an open-source platform for like, image generation, there&amp;rsquo;s been talks about them releasing a language model that would be open source. So we&amp;rsquo;re kind of waiting for all of those things to come together before we make a decision. We would, I think we would prefer to build something that kind of, is aligned with our principles, but in the meantime, there&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of plug-ins that you can use that solve that use case and I think they do quite a good job with them, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Stephan, have you heard of &lt;a href=&#34;https://napkin.one/?via=nicole&#34;&gt;Napkin&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: No, I don&amp;rsquo;t know Napkin. Tell me more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: It&amp;rsquo;s, yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s an awesome service that I recently have been using. And it uses AI in a really interesting way, because I think there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of focus on using AI for like, generating blocks of text or outlines or images. But what Napkin does is it looks at your vault, well, it&amp;rsquo;s not a vault because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t do it for Obsidian, it looks at your Readwise highlights, and it uses AI to tag them intelligently. So, it has this interface where you can determine, you can click on like, a thought or a highlight, and it shows you intelligently linked other highlights that you already have, that you may not have put together. And sometimes they&amp;rsquo;re like, they&amp;rsquo;re not even using the same keyword or they&amp;rsquo;re not tagged the same way, but somehow it still figures it out. That kind of thing would be invaluable for Obsidian because there&amp;rsquo;s a lot to be said for manually linking things, but getting some help would be nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: I think that sounds awesome. I&amp;rsquo;m seeing a lot of comments here in the chat of like, people who are suggesting some different ideas and some plugins that I&amp;rsquo;m not even aware of that are already doing some more local AI stuff. I think that&amp;rsquo;s a, I think what&amp;rsquo;s amazing about the Obsidian community is we have people kind of, at every level of the spectrum of nerdiness. Like, we have like, people who are some of the most advanced engineers that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever talked to are developing their own custom plugins, and then we have people who are complete beginners and novices, not engineers, people who are just learning about note taking. We have a lot of young students in the community. And so, I like that we have the ability to have those people who are like, all the way at the deepest end of like, understanding all of those principles, able to start working on, you know, potential plugins and extensions that could do something like that. And that can be kind of a breeding ground where we can learn, what do people actually want out of that type of tool? But I do think that if we want to continue to stay true to these kind of principles of being local and private, there&amp;rsquo;s gonna be some constraints that we have to deal with that are actual like, performance constraints and technical constraints, that may mean Obsidian will be a little slower to get to those features than apps that are completely cloud-based where they can upload that to a server and do that, you know, somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Hm. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: So I think it is a very tricky challenge for us to try to solve that right away. I think we&amp;rsquo;re gonna tend to watch what plugin developers do, and then start to think about that in a year or two. &amp;lsquo;Cause right now there&amp;rsquo;s, I mean, literally every month there&amp;rsquo;s something new going on with AI and the open source packages that are going on. So, we&amp;rsquo;re maybe a little less cutting edge than the plugin ecosystem can be, if that makes sense, on the core side it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: It feels like you could get dependent on something very quickly there as well, and just kind get really kind of bogged down. And then, you know, a couple of people have said keep that as a plugin, it&amp;rsquo;s much better that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;accessibility-in-obsidian&#34;&gt;Accessibility in Obsidian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: There was a question, it was from Daniel Gartmann further up yeah, I don&amp;rsquo;t use a screen reader, but I think, you know, something that would need to be much more sort of, core fundamentals as obviously accessibility. I don&amp;rsquo;t know, maybe Daniel can say how, I don&amp;rsquo;t know how accessible Obsidian is to use with screen read, but read is-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: We&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of work in that area with, yeah, I would be curious to hear a little bit more detail from Daniel about what they&amp;rsquo;re looking for, but yeah, Obsidian is already compatible with screen readers. We have done a lot of work on that side, but if there&amp;rsquo;s things that are missing in that respect, I would say let us know in the community, on the forum or on Discord. We&amp;rsquo;re definitely, I agree that building that into core is a must. I think that&amp;rsquo;s super important. We&amp;rsquo;ve added a lot of new customization features over the past year, so I&amp;rsquo;m actually kind of curious to see if there are themes that get developed that are focused on different use cases. It&amp;rsquo;s much easier today to design themes than it was a year ago in my, one of my, that was one of my biggest contributions over the past year from a code standpoint, was rewriting the way that themes can be built. And so that means that you can very easily now create like, very high-contrast themes. Themes with different font sizes, different fonts that might help people who have, you know, who need help on the vision side. But then there&amp;rsquo;s other things like, ARIA labels and other kind of web technologies that we&amp;rsquo;re able to incorporate that make it easier with screen readers for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tags-vs-links&#34;&gt;Tags vs Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Okay, we have a question that is a little bit controversial. It&amp;rsquo;s from Germ Germain, whom I actually, by chance, met a few weeks ago in person. He says, &amp;ldquo;What is his opinion (Well, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna ask both of you) about tags versus links?&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: In my personal use? Or, how do you wanna clarify that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Yeah, in your personal use. Which one do you use more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: So I tend to use links more than tags, personally. So, I do have quite a few tags, but I tend to use links because I like to see everything in the, all the relationships in my backlinks, I guess, is how I would say it. And I like that links, for example, like, I&amp;rsquo;ll have a top-level categories for books that I&amp;rsquo;ve read. And so I just have a category called books. And I link to it. In my template, I still use tags. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually really know why. I just feel like I should have it there for future need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Future proofing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah, for future proofing. Like, if I ever create a note about a book, it has both a tag for book and a link to the category books. So that redundancy helps sometimes if I&amp;rsquo;m creating like a DataView list or something I have access to both of those different ways of filtering down. But I tend to prefer links. I think links have a lot, are more powerful and cross over more different things. I think tags, where I use them the most, is for kind of very narrow meta segmentation of a very specific thing, where there&amp;rsquo;s only like, a very narrow subset of notes that needs to be grouped in a way that a link wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make sense, or I don&amp;rsquo;t really wanna have a page for that concept. Am I making sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Mm hm. I&amp;rsquo;m still here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: But also, it&amp;rsquo;s not-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I&amp;rsquo;m still a fan of the folders, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Oh, I hear you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: No. Do you really?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Oh, half the people have gone, &amp;ldquo;Oh god!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah. I&amp;rsquo;m very-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: What are you even doing here?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: In my personal organization-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: No, I&amp;rsquo;m joking, I&amp;rsquo;m joking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I can explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: This is why I feel like Obsidian being not dogmatic about this is great, because people think in different ways. Like, I love that people can use folders or tags or links or all of them. Do whatever works for you. If it works for you, that&amp;rsquo;s great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I think partly goes back to what you were saying right at the beginning, which is, you know, where the file format is the thing, right? And so I use several other things on that group of files that I have there. And whilst, you know, it&amp;rsquo;s great if you can search the tags or you can do whatever you want with the tags or links in Obsidian when you are trying to find a file, to kind of pull into something. I use Marked, Brett Terpstra&amp;rsquo;s Marked quite a lot for Output. It&amp;rsquo;s a massive pain in the ass. Well, I mean, I use search a lot anyway on the Finder, but, you know, I much prefer to have some organization that works across other things that aren&amp;rsquo;t gonna handle tags. So that&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Well, to be fair, in our team vault, we do use folders for our like, internal grouping. But I think that that use case is very different than my personal notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Yeah, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: We have an answer from Daniel, actually. He says he has issues both for Windows and iOS screen reader support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Okay, well let&amp;rsquo;s-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: &amp;ldquo;I love the potential that Obsidian has for me as a blind person who&amp;rsquo;s already using notes in a text-based format.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Jump into Discord and let&amp;rsquo;s talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I don&amp;rsquo;t know how accessible Discord is, by the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: That&amp;rsquo;s a great question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Because we might be saying jump into something that&amp;rsquo;s really terrible for you to use on Discord. So, yeah, on the forum, I&amp;rsquo;m guessing the forum-&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: The forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: It runs on Discourse, doesn&amp;rsquo;t it, of the forum?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Correct, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I would imagine it&amp;rsquo;s kinda more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: If you go to obsidian.md/community, you&amp;rsquo;ll see the links there and send us your feedback. Or if you wanna just email &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:support@obsidian.md&#34;&gt;support@obsidian.md&lt;/a&gt; we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look. But the best is definitely through the community and we&amp;rsquo;ll definitely take a look, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Tell us who does that email go to? Of the three of you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Well, right now it&amp;rsquo;s like, a kind of a shared thing where you kind of look in there, but I think that most people who use the support inbox are for kind of like, our enterprise users. We prefer to use the community as the main place because there&amp;rsquo;s more transparency around that and like, other people can jump in and add their own kind of experiences with whatever the feature request or bug might be. So in general, that&amp;rsquo;s why we kind of direct people towards the community if they wanna provide some feature requests or bug fix requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: I was kind of hoping it triggered like, a kind of a bat signal that projected us an Obsidian sort of into the sky, the Obsidian crystal into the sky, and you all kinda come running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Yeah, unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s just one of those other things that, as we scale up, we have to find good ways of parsing what the community is looking for and how we can fit it into our roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;message-to-the-community&#34;&gt;Message to the community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t, I would love to have you stay, both of you, stay on for longer. You&amp;rsquo;re both welcome back, but I also wanna be mindful of your time. So thank you for coming on to talk about the future of Obsidian, Stephan, and for helping me interview him, Andy. Stephan, is there anything that you&amp;rsquo;d like to say to the community before we end?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Wow. Thank you. I just, I&amp;rsquo;m so thankful. I think that the thing that I love about Obsidian is, so many smart people and kind and like, kind people are part of the community. I love, you know, watching your videos, Nicole. You do such a great job of kind of making Obsidian feel more accessible. And I think that, in a way, like, beyond what we&amp;rsquo;re working on in terms of features and so on, like, the fact that we have such a friendly and collaborative and helpful community, is one of my favorite things. And so, I&amp;rsquo;m extremely thankful for that. You know, continue to be, continue doing an amazing job, being nice and helpful. Like, I think we&amp;rsquo;re still at the very beginning of people adopting these tools. Like, anyone who&amp;rsquo;s watching this is probably in the like, top 0.01% of people who knows anything about these, whatever you wanna call &amp;rsquo;em, tools for thought, how you like, some people have been calling it integrated thinking environment. Like, we&amp;rsquo;re creating a new generation of tools that help people unlock the way that they think. And anyone who&amp;rsquo;s watching this right now is kind of, pretty much on the cutting edge of that concept. And I&amp;rsquo;m really curious what happens if that idea becomes more pervasive in society. I&amp;rsquo;m very hopeful that it can help us solve a lot of big problems. And so, if you&amp;rsquo;re one of the, you know, nerds, I say that lovingly. Geeks, dorks, that are part of this conversation, I consider myself one of those, introducing people to Obsidian and being part of, you know, helping them learn how to kind of, make their thought process more reliable is just an amazing gift. Like, I just think that&amp;rsquo;s like, and you&amp;rsquo;re doing that every day with your videos, Nicole. And so, I wanna thank you for that. So that, it&amp;rsquo;s not a specific ask, but that&amp;rsquo;s just kind of the way that I feel and I hope we can continue that for a really long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Awesome. Thank you. I&amp;rsquo;ll talk to you both in a second, but we&amp;rsquo;ll say goodbye to everybody else. Thank you for joining us on this weekend, and see you next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andy: Thanks. Bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole: Bye!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephan: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have a new favorite Obsidian theme, and it&amp;rsquo;s called AnuPpuccin! Anup is as pretty and feature-packed as it is hard to spell/say. Didn&amp;rsquo;t know themes could have features? Anup comes with custom callouts, checkboxes, speech bubbles, and lots of color options.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Frontend vs Backend Performance Testing</title>

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20230201-frontend-vs-backend-performance-testing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Which should you do: frontend vs. backend performance testing? The short answer is both. Each has its pros and cons, but hybrid load testing combines them and gives you the most holistic view of performance, including frontend concerns like how quickly a page renders or perceived application performance as well as backend concerns like response times of individual components.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some AI tools for learning and taking notes that I&amp;rsquo;ve incorporated into my processes. AI is a controversial topic, but it&amp;rsquo;s important to remember it&amp;rsquo;s just like any other technology: it&amp;rsquo;s only as good as the people that wield it. In this video, I show some ways I use artificial intelligence to improve my learning and note-taking rather than to replace them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about my top 10 core plugins in Obsidian: the built-in options that improve your productivity without adding clutter and complexity to your notes. Unlike community plugins, core plugins are a lower security risk, yet provide a lot of extra value&amp;ndash; but they&amp;rsquo;re also easy to overlook. Here are my favourite underappreciated core plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My time management setup in Obsidian consists of a way to set goals, a daily note for rapid logging the present, and a review/retrospective system to evaluate past performance. In this video, I talk about all the plugins and apps I use to get all my responsibilities done&amp;ndash; without me feeling like I&amp;rsquo;m overwhelmed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about five different ways to take notes on YouTube videos in Obsidian, for those (like me) who love learning things on YouTube and want a way to capture new thoughts in Obsidian. I mention a few community plugins, a browser extension, and a separate service as well as my workflow for just using vanilla Obsidian, so you can take your pick!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Visual atomic note taking in Obsidian can be a great complement to taking notes in text form if you use tools like the Obsidian Excalidraw plugin. Obsidian Excalidraw lets you link and backlink with images, tag them for querying later, and even embed images AND parts of images. It&amp;rsquo;s an essential part of taking notes visually while not missing out on the benefits of plain text.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My colleague Paul Balogh and I demonstrate how to run distributed load testing using Kubernetes with k6 and k6 operator. k6 can already run up to 40,000 virtual users from a single load generator, but if you want to scale that up further, you can use the Kubernetes operator to create a k6 custom resource within your cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading on a Kindle can be more convenient than reading paperbacks because you can import your Kindle highlights and notes into Obsidian or your note-taking app of choice. Here are some tips for making the most out of every book you read.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Obsidian Canvas Core Plugin (new in v1.0.0)</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20221209-obsidian-canvas-core-plugin/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20221209-obsidian-canvas-core-plugin/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The new Obsidian Canvas core plugin was introduced recently in v1.1.0, currently available only to Insiders but soon available to everyone. Canvas is an optional plugin that gives Obsidian an infinitely scrolling space to arrange notes, media, and other cards (potentially including external websites). If you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scrintal.com/&#34;&gt;Scrintal&lt;/a&gt;, this core plugin brings some of the same visual thinking workflows to Obsidian, which I think is a very smart step.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you go about making notes actually useful? Using notes well entails taking good notes in the first place, processing them, and then creating something new out of them. In this video, I talk about the plugins that I use in every stage of the process, and some guidelines for how I actually make a note on something I&amp;rsquo;ve learned into content that I (and others) can make use of.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to create a content calendar in Obsidian just like in Notion, the new Obsidian Projects plugin presents new options for managing content using multiple views: Table, Board, Calendar, and Gallery to start with, but hopefully more in the future. Projects is a framework for creating new views for the same data and aims to play well with other plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The more notes you have, the more you might wonder if you should have multiple vaults in Obsidian. There is no definitive answer, but in this video, I talk about reasons you should have only one vault as well as good reasons to have several vaults, based on my own experience. Like with anything I say, take what&amp;rsquo;s useful and do what makes sense!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted rotating Notion database views in Obsidian? Marcus Olsson&amp;rsquo;s Obsidian Projects plugin does exactly that, letting you create Table, Board, Calendar, and Gallery views for the same notes in Obsidian, just like in Notion! Join us as Marcus shows us how this awesome new plugin works and how it can be used to display the same data in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wondering how to organize your notes in Obsidian? In this video, I talk about some methods in Obsidian for imposing structure and organization, the LATCH method for adding data to your data, and which methods I would use in Obsidian for each part of LATCH (Location, Alphabet, Time, Category, and Hierarchy). This is not meant to be a definitive or prescriptive guide for how YOU should organize your notes. Instead, take this as a look into how I prefer to do it, in the hopes that you may find inspiration for how you&amp;rsquo;d like to do it as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;https://shortform.com/nicole&#34;&gt;Shortform&lt;/a&gt; for over a year. I&amp;rsquo;ve written &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/shortform-to-readwise&#34;&gt;some code&lt;/a&gt; for it and I&amp;rsquo;ve also written &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210815-shortform-to-readwise/&#34;&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it. It&amp;rsquo;s an essential part of my workflow for taking better notes from books, particularly in conjunction with &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/nicole&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt; and my current note-taking tool of choice, &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md/&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s what you need to know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-shortform&#34;&gt;What is Shortform?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortform is a service that creates book summaries out of popular books, but it&amp;rsquo;s also so much more than that! They&amp;rsquo;re like Netflix but for books, if you can imagine that. The summaries that Shortform gives you are not just your typical high school level summaries of a book report that we used to do when we were younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-makes-shortform-different&#34;&gt;What makes Shortform different?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are things that differentiate Shortform from other book summary services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;researched-commentary&#34;&gt;Researched commentary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortform has really thoughtful and nuanced commentary that place it firmly head and shoulders above other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot of some Shortform commentary from the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3gO0gmP&#34;&gt;Why We Sleep&lt;/a&gt;, taken on the Shortform mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/shortform-why-we-sleep.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Shortform commentary from the book &amp;amp;ldquo;Why We Sleep&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlighted section is a Shortform note&amp;ndash; additional commentary that the Shortform team added. In this case, they are fact-checking the author, citing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sleep.pitt.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-AASM-Manual-for-Scoring-of-Sleep-and-Associated-Events-2007-.pdf&#34;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; that prove a statement the author made to be false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was reading this book, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really think about questioning those claims. But Shortform thoroughly goes over every claim that Walker, the author, made in thsi book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading with Shortform is like having somebody else read a book with you&amp;ndash; a more critical and more well-informed someone who has the time to fact-check statements. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like having your own personal book club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;shortform-vs-blinkist&#34;&gt;Shortform vs. Blinkist&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another service in this vein that I&amp;rsquo;ve used is &lt;a href=&#34;https://blinkist.com/&#34;&gt;Blinkist&lt;/a&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the same book in Shortform and Blinkist to figure out why I like Shortform so much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the Blinkist summary for the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3W8rFQH&#34;&gt;Indistractable&lt;/a&gt; looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/blinkist-indistractable-summary.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Blinkist summary of Indistractable&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blinkist is based on the idea that every book can be distilled into these &lt;em&gt;blinks&lt;/em&gt;: very short summaries of every idea. For this book it has eight. Each of these blinks is a few paragraphs long. Here&amp;rsquo;s what the first looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/blinkist-indistractable-first-section.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Blinkist&amp;amp;rsquo;s Indistractable blink&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blink is a straight summary. There&amp;rsquo;s no commentary. There&amp;rsquo;s no research or anything like that. It seems like the whole focus of this is to be able to distill exactly what the author has said and let other people do the work of trying to figure out for themselves whether something is true or not. There&amp;rsquo;s really not much more than just these blinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, if we look at the one on Shortform, this is the same book and it also has like a one page summary like Blinkist did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/shortform-indistractable-summary.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Shortform summary of Indistractable&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then it also has a full book guide, which goes through every single chapter or part and adds more detail into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/shortform-indistractable-first-section.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Shorform&amp;amp;rsquo;s Indistractable first part&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, Shortform takes a different approach: instead of just summarizing the book, they&amp;rsquo;re truly trying to explain it in their own unique way, providing examples and making it more readable using bullet points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;action-oriented-exercises&#34;&gt;Action-oriented exercises&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortform also has these exercises based on the things that the author has said in the book. These exercises are peppered throughout and between these chapters, and they really force you to put things into practice right away as soon as you learn them, which is another element of learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/shortform-indistractable-exercises.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of an exercise in Shortform&amp;amp;rsquo;s Indistractable summary&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;critical-thinking-comparisons-to-other-ideas&#34;&gt;Critical thinking: comparisons to other ideas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortform tries to examine ideas in the context of other books they&amp;rsquo;ve made summaries for. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of a Shortform note where Shortform suggests the summary of the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3NdqE5C&#34;&gt;How to Stop Worrying and Start Living&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/shortform-indistractable-comparison.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Shortform note connecting Indistractable to another book&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fans of the Zettelkasten method will be happy to see this, because Shortform often prompts me to consider the differences or similarities between ideas from different authors. It helps me see connections I might not have considered. Incidentally, I&amp;rsquo;ve also found many good books this way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-use-shortform-with-obsidian&#34;&gt;How to use Shortform with Obsidian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing that really sells it for me is the integration. Because I don&amp;rsquo;t want that learning to stop in the Shortform app. You know me, and I want everything in Obsidian. And Shortform has an integration that Blinkist does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually tried to solve this problem myself a year ago, because no integration existed. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210815-shortform-to-readwise/&#34;&gt;wrote a Python script&lt;/a&gt; that would take the Shortform highlights, because it has an API, and then call the Readwise API and kind of string them together. Now, that still works as far as I know, but that&amp;rsquo;s not what I recommend anymore. I talked to the Readwise founders and suggested to them that Shortform was a great company to partner with. Not too long after that, they came out with &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/changelog/shortform-import&#34;&gt;an awesome integration&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, sign up to both &lt;a href=&#34;https://shortform.com/nicole&#34;&gt;Shortform&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/nicole&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt;. They both have free trials, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to commit to anything just yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/welcome/sync#shortform&#34;&gt;click on this link to connect&lt;/a&gt; your Readwise account to Shortform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(optional) If you use Obsidian like I do, &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210810-readwise-to-obsidian-redux/&#34;&gt;follow these instructions&lt;/a&gt; to install the Readwise Official plugin for Obsidian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s pretty much it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on, here&amp;rsquo;s how things will work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You make highlights on books on Shortform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those highlights are sent to Readwise automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through the Readwise official plugin, those highlights get synced into your Obsidian vault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-result-shortform-highlights-in-obsidian&#34;&gt;The result: Shortform highlights in Obsidian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what my Shortform highlights look like in Obsidian. Note that after setting this up, all I had to do was make highlights on Shortform&amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s quite low-touch after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-shortform-indistractable.png&#34; alt=&#34;Shorform highlights synced to Obsidian vault via Readwise&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tweaked the export settings in Readwise to set the format I want the note to have in Obsidian. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to do this, but if you want to, you can change those settings &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/export/obsidian/preferences&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-shortform-workflow-for-taking-notes-on-books&#34;&gt;My Shortform workflow for taking notes on books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty much how a lot of my book-buying and -reading goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I start by browsing books on Shortform and read the one-page summaries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I find one I like, I buy the book on Kindle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I make highlights on the Kindle version. (Those are synced to Obsidian too!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I really like the book, I flip back to the Shortform detailed chapter summaries as I finish each chapter, because they provide more context. I make highlights and notes from Shortform here sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes I do the Shortform exercises too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After I finish the book, I go back to the Shortform summary and make more highlights/notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After I&amp;rsquo;ve read my fill of both the Shortform summary and the book itself, I go back to Obsidian and write my own notes that combine what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds like a lot, it is! But keep in mind that I don&amp;rsquo;t do this for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; book. At every step of the way, Shortform helps me filter out books that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to read, or don&amp;rsquo;t want to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortform definitely saves me money: it costs less than a book a month and it stops me from reading more than one book a month. From that perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s already worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more than that, the thoughtfulness of the summaries and the research that goes into those commentaries save me more than just money: &lt;em&gt;they save me time&lt;/em&gt;. And that&amp;rsquo;s really what I keep coming back for.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Leandro Melendez and Nicole van der Hoeven discuss all about load testing metrics. What do they all mean? Which ones do you REALLY need? Understanding metrics and analysing test results is arguably the most important part of a load test&amp;ndash; and also the most difficult! We&amp;rsquo;re answering all the questions you ever had about the many metrics that come with load and performance testing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about how to get started with Obsidian for non-coders, specifically tackling topics like what Markdown is and how to use it to write notes in Obsidian. I also talk about some Obsidian-specific syntax that help you do things like embed Obsidian notes, create footnotes, and create queries to find the right note.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Introducing: Tabs in Obsidian v1.0! Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s latest release brings tab functionality to Obsidian, further adding to its flexibility in terms of letting us build workspaces the way we want. We can now have tabs in Obsidian and use them the way we would browser tabs. This release also came with some improvements for themes and the overall Obsidian UI.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this real use case for Obsidian, I use plugins like Dataview, Database Folder, QuickAdd, Templater, and Buttons to create a database in Obsidian to track Kickstarter projects I&amp;rsquo;ve backed. I show two approaches to creating a database and demonstrate a relatively new plugin, Database Folder, which shows a lot of promise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I demonstrate how I learn Swedish in 30 days using Obsidian and other apps. Learning foreign languages is never easy, but having a system in place definitely makes the process easier. The Obsidian Spaced Repetition plugin in particular helps create flashcards that I can use on my laptop or mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I demonstrate how to use the ExcaliBrain Obsidian plugin and what it can be used for. ExcaliBrain is a very powerful plugin, and it can significantly improve your Obsidian workflows. I also mention go through installing and getting started with ExcaliBrain at four different levels of uses for it: letting it infer relationships, setting explicit relationships, creating custom relationships, and finally creating semantic relationships in ExcaliBrain.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Readwise Reader is the latest read-it-later app, except not just for books. Reader brings in your highlights from books, articles, tweets, PDFs, epubs, emails, and even newsletters! While it&amp;rsquo;s not yet officially launched, it&amp;rsquo;s now in public beta and you can sign up to be put on a wait list to try out this awesome product that&amp;rsquo;s been so essential to my workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: I do have an affiliate link of &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/nicole&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt;, but this video was not sponsored. They know I&amp;rsquo;m making this video, because I had to reach out to get permission to post the screenshot of a private email, but they did not review this video and had no idea what I was going to say. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I demonstrate how to take notes from a book (The Culture Map) using Obsidian. In the process of taking notes, I also create learning exhaust in the form of notes, an atomic essay to go on Twitter, a visual that summarises a concept, and a video presentation. Taking notes from books is more than just understanding what the author wanted to say; it should also involve consolidation and interrogation of the book&amp;rsquo;s ideas into our personal knowledge management systems.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I demonstrate how to make your notes visual with visual PKM plugins like Excalidraw, Excalibrain, Advanced Slides, and Mind Map. Adding visual elements to your notes, whether through distinguishing text or adding images and video, helps make notes more meaningful to you, increasing understanding and retention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re wondering why I&amp;rsquo;ve lived in 5 countries, here&amp;rsquo;s a video to explain it. Living abroad is something I do intentionally, and with an eye on how it would affect me financially. 5 countries might sound extreme, but I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed every one! Every country has its taxation quirks, but doing the research will reveal a lot of opportunities to live the life you want while effectively earning more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about creating k6 scripts with the browser recorder and by using your favorite IDE. Scripts in k6 can be created through the Test Builder on the k6 Cloud, but sometimes you just want to hit record instead of starting from scratch. Also in this video is a rundown on the basics of using the k6 CLI and some important commands for running tests locally and on the cloud&amp;ndash; right from your command line.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I share how to use maps in Obsidian using the Obsidian Leaflet and Kanban plugins, specifically for planning a move to another country. Using a map and marking places on it is a great way to keep track of your exploration of a country when you&amp;rsquo;re not quite sure where to live yet!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What do you do with all those notes? In this presentation, I talk about how to create things with your notes. I demonstrate my process of going from raw notes to this very presentation and share some of my strategies for creating output with little effort by learning in public and identifying topics to create content about using existing notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 19th, I did a talk at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20220519-use-it-or-lose-it/&#34;&gt;Linking Your Thinking Conference&lt;/a&gt; about using your notes (or losing them), and about what we can do to make something useful of all our notes. This was my run through!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know you can create a visual map of content in Obsidian to consolidate your notes? The Excalidraw plugin by Zsolt Viczian can be used to create a dashboard in Obsidian, take sketchnotes instead of text notes, express your ideas visually, and many more. Maps of content are useful for bottom-up thinking, and having a visual representation of your notes can inspire you to consider other perspectives or communicate your ideas in a clearer way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220601-how-to-be-a-gish-expoqa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the ExpoQA 2022 conference in Madrid, Spain, I presented a talk about how to be a gish. In this talk, I covered the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what a gish is, and how it applies to the field of testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how testing is a multidisciplinary field, and why generalists triumph over specialists in the face of uncertainty&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how the tool we choose to do our testing informs the type of testing and the type of results we get&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a hands-on example of how to do API load testing, browser automation, and chaos engineering in one script using a tool like &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/&#34;&gt;k6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Obsidian Advanced Slides plugin is a great way to create presentations as code (or notes) from right inside your Obsidian vault. Using this plugin has helped me reduce the friction and the time between creating something and sharing it, whether that&amp;rsquo;s a presentation, a coding project, a video, or a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a glaring gap in most productivity systems: time. How do REAL people, with real jobs and obligations, find the time to process notes? Is Inbox Zero an achievable and sustainable goal? I think the answer is no. In this video, I talk about what to do instead, and what is a healthier way to look at productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Notion and Obsidian are similar in many ways, but they have a fundamental difference in philosophy and the way they structure notes.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transcript:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from writing technical documentation in the last few years is that good writing is skimmable, at least in the digital age. So since I look at my notes in Obsidian the same way as I do a sort of personal documentation, I think that a lot of the same principles apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I wanna talk about an early access feature that the Obsidian team rolled out two weeks ago, and it&amp;rsquo;s called Callouts. So before I demonstrate this, I want to say that this is only available right now in the Insider Build version 0.14, but that build always gets pushed to the public, it&amp;rsquo;s just a little bit ahead of the public release. So think of this as a bit of a sneak preview. &lt;em&gt;(Note: Obsidian callouts is &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Use+callouts&#34;&gt;out now&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-obsidian-admonition&#34;&gt;What about Obsidian Admonition?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before Obsidian Callouts was released, I was using something called Obsidian Admonition. So if we go here, I can bring up my Obsidian Admonition page, and it looked something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would do three backticks. That&amp;rsquo;s kind of the code block syntax. And you would do something like add note. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;d have a title here, like reminder, and then you&amp;rsquo;d have your note here. And because I have Live Preview turned on, if I enter out of this, it&amp;rsquo;s going to look like this. So this is what Obsidian Admonition always looked like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in general, the idea here is that to make your writing more skimmable, you have these kind of, well, callout boxes that highlight sections of your text and make sure that they address something that is about the notes that you&amp;rsquo;re writing, kind of like meta notes, they&amp;rsquo;re notes about your notes, but because they&amp;rsquo;re visually distinguished from the rest of the text, it&amp;rsquo;s a lot easier for you or for your readers to easily figure out whether something is important to read or only in specific situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;admonitioncallout-example&#34;&gt;Admonition/callout example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that happens a lot in technical documentation, so it&amp;rsquo;s no secret that I have used it a lot in sort of programming kind of notes. So if we go back to my vault here, let&amp;rsquo;s look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/g&#34;&gt;my note on g&lt;/a&gt;. g is a package manager for Go, the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s a type of callout or admonition that I used. And this is kind of like this page tells you how to use, what g is and how to use it. But this note, this particular callout, is kind of like an aside. It&amp;rsquo;s like, hey, just in case you get this error, here&amp;rsquo;s how to troubleshoot it. And it&amp;rsquo;s really cool that it&amp;rsquo;s hidden by, it&amp;rsquo;s collapsed by default. And you can just click on that, and then it says, oh, if you get the error, g not found, hey, maybe restart your shell session after installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that sort of callout really helps when you&amp;rsquo;re trying to quickly skim a page. So programming is certainly one use for it, and another one is tutorials in general. You know, I have this a lot for my Obsidian stuff in case I need to say that this only works for Mac or this only works for windows or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I also use it a lot in my D&amp;amp;D games. As a Dungeon Master, I have different scenarios that I may not even need to go into depending on what my players decide to do. That is the perfect task for callouts or for admonitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enter-obsidian-callouts&#34;&gt;Enter Obsidian Callouts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was using this admonitions format with a code block for, basically, since I learned about it. It is made by a TTRPG plugin developer called Jeremy Valentine, and he&amp;rsquo;s made a lot of very popular ones, like the Dice Roller and the Initiative Tracker and Leaflet, and it just goes on and on. But I&amp;rsquo;m digressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plugin was apparently so good that even the Obsidian team realized that it really should be part of Obsidian, because a key part of Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s functionality is documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the big release is that they&amp;rsquo;ve now incorporated Admonitions-like functionality into core Obsidian, not a core plugin, so it&amp;rsquo;s not something that you even have to install or enable, it just ships by default with Obsidian, which is really awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-use-obsidian-callouts&#34;&gt;How to use Obsidian Callouts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s look into how to use it. I&amp;rsquo;m going to go to my Obsidian Callouts page here. And the syntax is a little bit different from the admonitions one. Instead of the code blocks with the three backticks, this callouts functionality now uses blockquotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;[!info] Your title
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;The contents of your note here
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you do a single blockquote like an arrow, and then you do brackets, and then an exclamation point. And then there are a bunch of different types, which we&amp;rsquo;ll get into, but the most common one, I guess, is note. Then you would put your title here, and then you can put the rest of the note here. So this is now doing it as a blockquote. And if I exit out of that, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that it has a nice icon of a kinda pencil or pen there, and it is visually distinguished from the rest of the note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;types-of-callouts&#34;&gt;Types of Callouts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;note&#34;&gt;note&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s go into the types, &amp;lsquo;cause there are a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one I already showed you, this is a note. I put this within code blocks just to show you the syntax. And then this is what it looks like. Basically, this is the standard format of callouts, you just change whatever&amp;rsquo;s here. And then you always put the title outside of the brackets, and then the content of the note below it. So this is what a note looks like. That&amp;rsquo;s probably the most common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract-summary-tldr&#34;&gt;abstract, summary, tldr&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then another one is abstract, summary, or TLDR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, all of these are the same, so like this is a TLDR, so I can actually edit it here as well. So here in this case, I was using TLDR, but if I do abstract, it&amp;rsquo;s going to look, actually, it looks a little bit different now that I think about it I thought it was going to look the same, but it&amp;rsquo;s also dependent on the theme that you&amp;rsquo;re using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so these three are actually different, even though they&amp;rsquo;re semantically the same. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s interesting. I just literally found that out right now as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;info-todo&#34;&gt;info, todo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s info and todo. So this I believe is the todo. And if I go to info, it looks slightly different, just has a little eye here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I use for descriptions. What we call it in TTRPG is what we call box text, when players enter a new scene and there&amp;rsquo;s a part that you read out word for word, rather than improvising it. This is what I use for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tip-hint-important&#34;&gt;tip, hint, important&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you have tips, hint, tip, hint, or important. This one is a tip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see what important looks like. All right. Yeah, all right. So there&amp;rsquo;s some highlighting going on there as well, and it&amp;rsquo;s marked by an asterisk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;success-check-done&#34;&gt;success, check, done&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s success, check, done. I particularly like, I think it was done. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of like the todo had a checkbox. This one actually has the check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;questions-help-faq&#34;&gt;questions, help, faq&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s questions, help, or faq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;warning-caution-attention&#34;&gt;warning, caution, attention&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s warning, caution, or attention, which is what I use for errors or gotchas when you&amp;rsquo;re programming or something things that you might fall into that I want to call out, because I did fall into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fail-failure-missing&#34;&gt;fail, failure, missing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s also fail, failure, and missing. So this is all bad stuff, essentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;danger-error&#34;&gt;danger, error&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s danger, error. It looks like this with a little lightning symbol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bug&#34;&gt;bug&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s bug, which I use quite a bit when I&amp;rsquo;m reporting bugs or documenting bugs, anyway. This example, which kind of looks like abstract, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;quote-cite&#34;&gt;quote, cite&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quote, and cite, which is kind of a blockquote, except a little bit fancier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;collapsing-and-expanding-callouts&#34;&gt;Collapsing and expanding callouts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as you can see, there are a lot of different types of callouts. And aside from all of those, you can also choose whether it&amp;rsquo;s collapsed or expanded, and that&amp;rsquo;s kind of the folding behavior that I showed you earlier. So let&amp;rsquo;s just do that now as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to say bug, and I&amp;rsquo;ll say bug detected, let&amp;rsquo;s say. And this time though, where just before the title, right outside of the parenthesis for the type that I&amp;rsquo;m using, I&amp;rsquo;m going to type a minus. And I&amp;rsquo;ll put, this is a bug. And I get out of that. This is what it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is very different from this one where it&amp;rsquo;s just expanded by default, that&amp;rsquo;s a default behavior, but if you add the minus there, that means that you&amp;rsquo;re saying that this must be minimized or collapsed by default. So then you can always click on that, and look, you see what was in the text there. You can also specify that it&amp;rsquo;s always expanded by default, but it already is always expanded by default, so you don&amp;rsquo;t really have to set that, unless you&amp;rsquo;ve changed the settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;benefits-of-obsidian-callouts&#34;&gt;Benefits of Obsidian Callouts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;better-documentation&#34;&gt;Better documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is a really cool and easy way of having these different colors. I know a lot of people that have come from Notion are kind of missing some of that in Obsidian. Well, this is an easy way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ability-to-modify-callouts&#34;&gt;Ability to modify callouts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you can also change how it looks by modifying either the CSS of the theme or by selecting themes that just really use it and display it to its advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theme here that I&amp;rsquo;m using is, let me check that, because I&amp;rsquo;m sure that people will ask. This is one of the gems of the year, one of the themes that won, it&amp;rsquo;s called Primary. Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s really cool, and it&amp;rsquo;s on the light setting. This is a test vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;callouts-are-native-on-obsidian-publish&#34;&gt;Callouts are native on Obsidian Publish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one of the coolest things about this new callouts feature is that it now works natively on Obsidian Publish. So I use Obsidian Publish for my public Obsidian vault, that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Obsidian+Callouts&#34;&gt;notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;rsquo;ll be a link in the description if you want to see what that looks like. It&amp;rsquo;s basically my way of learning in public. And I select different notes to publish on there for people to see, for anybody to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for a long time, admonitions, because it&amp;rsquo;s a plugin, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t show up up there. And then there was a way to do it where you can change the CSS and then kind of do it that way, but now that callouts is in core Obsidian, you don&amp;rsquo;t even have to do that. It&amp;rsquo;s just going to work right out of the box. So all of your notes that have the Obsidian callout syntax on them will show up the same way in your Obsidian Publish site, which is really awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-did-the-format-change-from-admonition-to-callouts&#34;&gt;Why did the format change from Admonition to callouts?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you might think, this is really just a format change, right? From admonition to callout, and part of it is that. I asked about why they changed the format, and the answer was that having the blockquote format falls back to blockquotes in unsupported Markdown renderer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-format-works-better-even-if-callouts-arent-supported&#34;&gt;New format works better even if callouts aren&amp;rsquo;t supported&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for example, if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this note in an ID and IDE that doesn&amp;rsquo;t support that syntax, it&amp;rsquo;s at least still just going to look like a blockquote, which does make more sense than it looking like a code block, because you might not have code there. This is not just for code, this is for any sort of like sticky note that you wanna put on your notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;markdown-inside-blockquotes-gets-parsed&#34;&gt;Markdown inside blockquotes gets parsed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also because it just uses blockquotes, this means that all of the Markdown inside it also gets parsed, including links and embeds and even Dataview queries apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that also means that spellcheck can check it. Because if you put something in a code block, that&amp;rsquo;s kind of a signal for spellchecks not to have a look at the contents of that code block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;does-this-completely-replace-obsidian-admonition&#34;&gt;Does this completely replace Obsidian Admonition?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what happens with admonition? Because it&amp;rsquo;s been around for a while, it&amp;rsquo;s actually still up. And in fact, admonition-style code blocks will continue to work. They&amp;rsquo;re now supporting, Obsidian is now supporting both the callouts and admonition if you have admonition plugin still enabled, then you&amp;rsquo;re still going to be able to use both. So it&amp;rsquo;s not like it&amp;rsquo;s going away, but you should probably use the callout syntax going forward, just because that&amp;rsquo;s what everyone&amp;rsquo;s going to be developing based off of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;admonition-can-convert-between-formats&#34;&gt;Admonition can convert between formats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there is also another thing that admonition is going to do is it does conversion. So if you have existing code block admonitions, then those can be converted to callouts. Actually, I want to show where you can find that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you go to settings here and look at admonition, there are a bunch of settings here, but let&amp;rsquo;s look at, yeah, the conversions. You convert MSDoc admonitions to callouts, and you can convert code block admonitions to callouts as well. Now, this will modify your notes, so just be a little bit careful with it. Save a backup or do a push to Git if you save it in a Git repo like I do. But that&amp;rsquo;s what admonition is going to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;admonition-lets-you-change-callout-appearance&#34;&gt;Admonition lets you change callout appearance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in addition to that, it&amp;rsquo;s also shifted to being able to let you change the appearance of those callouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it has a bunch of functionality like, do you wanna add drop shadows? And do you want it to be collapsible by default? Because I said that it&amp;rsquo;s expanded by default, but you could change that behavior and toggle it. And then, you could still just expand it on a case-by-case basis. But if you don&amp;rsquo;t specify anything, then it&amp;rsquo;ll just say that it should be collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also the add copy button, which is actually really interesting because a lot of times that is something that I just want to copy and paste to like my players or something if I wanna paste a description or if it actually is a code block or some sort of troubleshooting thing, so I enable that. And you can set admonition colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also change the icons that are loaded there. So right now, admonition uses the Font Awesome icons. So I was showing you all of these different types of callouts, right? But those are the default ones. And admonition adds the Font Awesome ones as well. And you can even add your own types of icons. So you can load additional icons. There&amp;rsquo;s Octicons and RPG-Awesome, which sounds really interesting, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a cool effect of that is we need to do this in admonition syntax, so it&amp;rsquo;s code blocks. Let&amp;rsquo;s say, let&amp;rsquo;s just go with question. This is a question. A cool thing that you can do with admonition is you can do icon, and then choose an icon that isn&amp;rsquo;t already in there. So as an example, I happen to know that there is a Font Awesome icon that&amp;rsquo;s a cloud, so I&amp;rsquo;m just going to put cloud there and then I&amp;rsquo;m going to put, here&amp;rsquo;s the answer. If I go out there, look, now it looks like a little green cloud, so I can change everything about how it looks. This is still in the admonition syntax, though, but it functions the same way as callouts, just extended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like this for being able to give instructions and then say, you know, this is Apple-only and not for Windows. So that&amp;rsquo;s really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;should-you-keep-using-obsidian-admonition&#34;&gt;Should you keep using Obsidian Admonition?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess the question is, and this was my question when I learned about these changes, is it still worthwhile to use admonitions because of all these quality-of-life improvements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is, because, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I&amp;rsquo;m very happy that callouts is part of Obsidian now, that just made sense for an app that is so focused on notes and note-taking and documentation. You really need these different ways to take notes on your notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;custom-icons-and-admonition-types&#34;&gt;Custom icons and admonition types&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do think think that admonition is still worthwhile installing and using if you want to delve down into the specifics of this feature. So if you want different icons that make sense to you, but maybe not to other people, this is still the best way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;user-interface-for-inserting-callouts-or-admonitions&#34;&gt;User interface for inserting callouts OR admonitions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another cool thing that I didn&amp;rsquo;t show, let me show that now, is maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t want to remember the syntax with either with the blockquotes or with the code blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with admonition turned on and enable, installed and enabled, you can bring up your command pane, which for me is Command + P, and I&amp;rsquo;m gonna type in admonition, and then you can just either a callout or an admonition and a bunch of other things as well, but I&amp;rsquo;m just going to insert a callout. And if you didn&amp;rsquo;t remember what the types were, they&amp;rsquo;re all here. And this is what they&amp;rsquo;re going to look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as I mentioned, I think these, the ones that I grouped, are actually supposed to look the same without the admonition plugin, it&amp;rsquo;s just that either the admonition plugin or my theme is making them look a little bit different, but these are the standard ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then you can choose which one you want. You can have the title there. You can choose whether or not it is collapsible. It even shows you a preview. So let&amp;rsquo;s insert that. And look, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to type out any of that and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to remember any of that syntax. So that&amp;rsquo;s just a nice little upgrade that you can only get with admonitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-callouts-is-available-now&#34;&gt;Obsidian callouts is available now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Obsidian callouts is available for all users for free now!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, Obsidian callouts, at the time of this recording, is only available in Insider Build version 0.14, which means you can only get it right now, if you need to get it right now, you&amp;rsquo;d have to pay for the Catalyst plan, which is a one-off $25 fee. I&amp;rsquo;ve paid that just because I wanted to give back to the Obsidian developers for this amazing tool that they just give for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you&amp;rsquo;re willing to wait, this feature, like all features, will soon be publicly available, Insiders just get it a little bit earlier. And when that happens, I&amp;rsquo;ll pin a comment in the comments below for this video so that you know when it&amp;rsquo;s available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn about other Obsidian plugins, I do have &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/W7kTtn9empU&#34;&gt;a video on the top 10 Obsidian plugins&lt;/a&gt;, so maybe check that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for watching!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>E-residency Benefits: Why and How to Start a Company in Estonia</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220316-e-residency-benefits-why-and-how-to-start-a-company-in-estonia/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Mar 2022 17:09:33 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220316-e-residency-benefits-why-and-how-to-start-a-company-in-estonia/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about why I got e-residency four years ago, and how I used it to start a company in Estonia. I also mention a service called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xolo.io/ref/NICVAN2&#34;&gt;Xolo&lt;/a&gt; that I use to manage my Estonian company and do my taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/k0whs1m5OYQ&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;85,000 people from all over the world are Estonian e-residents. And in 2018, I became one of them. I set up my own Estonian company. And for the last four years I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some freelance work through it with clients in the U.S. and the EU. In this video, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna talk about why I started an Estonia company, and if you&amp;rsquo;re interested, how you can do it too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tax-benefits&#34;&gt;Tax benefits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first reason was taxes. Now, wait, if you are one of those people that think that Estonia is some sort of tax haven, you&amp;rsquo;d be wrong. You&amp;rsquo;re not going to be paying no taxes but you may be paying lower taxes than what you&amp;rsquo;re used to, depending on where you live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Estonian tax system is also simple&amp;ndash; well, simpler than most tax systems. Everything is in English. I personally don&amp;rsquo;t speak Estonian, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t had any difficulty finding out rulings, everything is online and accessible in English via the Estonian government&amp;rsquo;s site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;control&#34;&gt;Control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason I started my company there was control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a freelancer, you may not have as much control over your financial affairs as you would like. The government probably dictates to some extent what you can declare as expenses or how much you get to take as income. There are still rules around that for Estonian companies, but in general I&amp;rsquo;ve found the rules to be way more reasonable and lenient than I would otherwise have to contend with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if you&amp;rsquo;re a small business and you choose to reinvest the profit that you&amp;rsquo;ve made into your business, so for example, buying equipment that you need or paying for other sort of operating expenses, then you don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay taxes on that income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;remote-friendly&#34;&gt;Remote-friendly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My third reason is that Estonian companies are set up to be remote friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a very big deal to me, because when I set up a company here in the Netherlands, I had to be here, I had to have a permanent address where I could send correspondence by snail mail and they would piecemeal like my password and little bits of information and other unique IDs that I would later need to lodge my tax returns and other paperwork. There was so much back and forth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estonia isn&amp;rsquo;t like that. Everything is completely online. You do have to still have a physical address for your company, but there&amp;rsquo;s a way around that which I will get to soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-cool-factor&#34;&gt;The Cool Factor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fourth reason, of course, is, honestly, the cool factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very much a proponent of new technologies and being able to take advantage of things that are cool about other countries is something that I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of. So when Estonia set up this e-residency program I was pretty sure that I was going to be applying for e-residency, even if I didn&amp;rsquo;t go ahead with my company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is the way of the future. And I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see how many more countries are going to do it, following in Estonia&amp;rsquo;s footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;should-you-manage-your-company-yourself&#34;&gt;Should you manage your company yourself?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s why I started a company, but usually it&amp;rsquo;s the logistics around actually starting it that are more difficult than the decision itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a kind of person who prefers to do everything on her own. Just to give you an idea, I do my taxes, my husband&amp;rsquo;s taxes and company taxes here in the Netherland in Dutch. I specifically got lessons on reading the tax code in the Netherlands in Dutch. I also do it for Australia because we still have a property there and some other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so I&amp;rsquo;m telling you this to say, I am not one to shy away from reading tax laws of another country, getting up to speed, and doing it myself. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that that is often not just the most cost efficient way, but actually the best way to maximize it because nobody else cares about my finances more than me. That&amp;rsquo;s not the strategy that I took with Estonia. I actually have hired a company to do that for me which is quite unusual, and they&amp;rsquo;re called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xolo.io/ref/NICVAN2&#34;&gt;Xolo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-does-xolo-do&#34;&gt;What does Xolo do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quick disclaimer here, this is not sponsored by Xolo or anybody else. I haven&amp;rsquo;t spoken to them. They don&amp;rsquo;t know I&amp;rsquo;m making this video. My communications with them have been related to my personal financial circumstances. So they in no way had anything to do with what I&amp;rsquo;m about to say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only reason that I&amp;rsquo;m using my referral link is that I think it&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty useful. So the deal is that I get 150 euro if you use the link but you get 265 euro, which is exactly how much it costs for you to start up a company. I mean, if you want to go and try Xolo without using my referral code, please feel free to&amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s xolo.io. But 265 euro is also a lot of money. So it&amp;rsquo;s up to you. I do have an ethics statement about this sort of thing. Basically I will never promote or even talk about a product or service positively unless I&amp;rsquo;ve been consistently using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an email from Xolo in 2018, Back when they were still called LeapIn, just to prove to you that I&amp;rsquo;ve actually been using them for four years and heartily recommend their service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can start up an Estonian company all on your own without really any help from any other company, but it will take a lot more work if you&amp;rsquo;re just trying to find the easiest way possible. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that this is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;xolos-offerings&#34;&gt;Xolo&amp;rsquo;s offerings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xolo offers a few services. First, they help you with registering your company. So you pay the fee to the state, not to them. It&amp;rsquo;s 265 euro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They provide a physical address that your company can use. That includes mail forwarding, if you happen to use that for any company-related or government-related communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They help you with applying for a VAT number if you need that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they also help you with opening up a bank account. Now, I think that there are ways so that you can just use something like PayPal or Wise for your bank account. I did those, but I also chose to have an actual bank account in Estonia. That is the only part in this process where you actually have to be in Tallinn, in Estonia. Personally, I was looking for an excuse to go to Tallinn, so I went there and set one up. It was pretty easy but you can certainly start a company without it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing that Xolo do is that they lodge the taxes for you every year. They give you advice on your company structure. They keep track of your expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the best part about Xolo is that everything is done online. They have a really nice web app which is pretty slick and modern and user friendly, and that&amp;rsquo;s what I use to upload my receipts, or if I need something reimbursed or marked as an expense, or if I&amp;rsquo;ve paid for something with my own pocket, and need the company to reimburse me, then everything is just handled for me. I really think that this is one of the selling points because if I have to get on the phone and actually talk to someone and explain something, I&amp;rsquo;m out. I&amp;rsquo;d rather just do it on my own at that point. But in the four years that I&amp;rsquo;ve been with Xolo, I haven&amp;rsquo;t had to be on the phone with them once. Their entire staff corresponds by email promptly and really in a thorough, professional way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;xolos-pricing&#34;&gt;Xolo&amp;rsquo;s pricing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s talk pricing. Xolo costs either 49, 79 or 199 euros a month. And that includes all of those services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing that&amp;rsquo;s not included is the state fee. And that&amp;rsquo;s something that you pay to the Estonian government. That&amp;rsquo;s the 265 euro to actually get your company registered. You can check that out for yourself on the government site. This is something that you&amp;rsquo;ll have to pay even if you don&amp;rsquo;t go through Xolo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;step-by-step-process-of-starting-a-company&#34;&gt;Step-by-step process of starting a company&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you wanna start a company in Estonia, here&amp;rsquo;s what you have to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-1-click-on-my-referral-link-to-sign-up-to-xolo&#34;&gt;Step 1: Click on my referral link to sign up to Xolo&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, click on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.xolo.io/ref/NICVAN2&#34;&gt;the referral link&lt;/a&gt; before the end of March. So March 31st, 2022, you have to have clicked the link.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that you have to have paid by then. You just have to have clicked it and gone through the signup process to create a completely free account. At this point, there is no obligation that you&amp;rsquo;re going to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;step-2-apply-for-e-residency&#34;&gt;Step 2: Apply for e-residency&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, you have to apply for e-residency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is something that you&amp;rsquo;ll have to do directly with the Estonia government&amp;rsquo;s site, which is pretty easy. There&amp;rsquo;s a link below to an application form that you&amp;rsquo;re gonna need to fill out with your information and identification. And then you wait around for, usually it takes less than a month. For me, I think it took a couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when it&amp;rsquo;s approved you&amp;rsquo;ll get an email notification asking you to go to your local embassy. So in my case, I applied while I was already in the Netherlands. So I went to the embassy or consulate of Estonia here in the Netherlands just to pick up this ID and get fingerprinted. The e-residency itself costs 120 euro, but it is a one-off fee and you never have to pay for it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;pay-for-xolo-leap&#34;&gt;Pay for Xolo Leap&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the last step is to pay for a Xolo leap plan before May 31st, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you essentially get two full months to do your e-residency. And it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t really take that time. And if you used my referral link, once you sign up for the plan, then they&amp;rsquo;ll waive the 265 euro that you would need to pay to the state for your company&amp;rsquo;s registration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much it. After that, Xolo will tell you how to proceed and give you the options for banking and that, depending on your business&amp;rsquo; unique requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please don&amp;rsquo;t take any of this as tax or financial advice because I&amp;rsquo;m not a tax professional and I&amp;rsquo;m not a financial advisor. I am simply sharing my experiences and referring you to experts who will certainly know better than me on Estonian taxation law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a company in Estonia is an essential part of my strategy for maximizing my freedom and building the life that I want by moving aspects of my life to countries that are best suited for them. This practice is called flag theory. And if you wanna learn more about that, check out this video to see how I use it to improve my life. Thank you for watching. Or as they say in Estonian, I think, &lt;em&gt;aitäh&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Real Browser Testing With xk6-browser</title>

      <description>
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/y04wavsZxSs&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transcript:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without a doubt, my favorite k6 extension is xk6-browser. xk6-browser finally brings browser test automation to k6. So you don&amp;rsquo;t need to learn a new tool or figure out how to integrate it if you already have load tests. You can create JavaScript-based, browser-driven tests with k6. Here&amp;rsquo;s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since xk6-browser is an extension, we&amp;rsquo;re gonna need to build a custom version of k6 that includes that extension. And the thing that builds that is called xk6. What I&amp;rsquo;m doing here is I&amp;rsquo;m instructing xk6 to create a build using version 0.35 of k6, that includes xk6-browser. And this is a link to the repository where xk6-browser is stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing-a-browser-testing-script&#34;&gt;Writing a browser testing script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now that we have a version of k6 that includes xk6-browser, the next step is to create the browser script. Now you can do that in the one script, but just for ease of debugging I&amp;rsquo;m gonna put it in another script for now. We&amp;rsquo;re not going to be using the HTTP requests anymore so I&amp;rsquo;m going to import launcher from k6/x/browser. And I&amp;rsquo;ll save that as browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m definitely going to be using sleep, so let me go ahead and import that now as well. We&amp;rsquo;ll also need a default function for this. We&amp;rsquo;re setting up an instance of the launcher that&amp;rsquo;s going to launch Chromium in particular, and we do want to see it so I&amp;rsquo;m going to say &lt;code&gt;headless: false&lt;/code&gt;. If you set this to true, that means that you won&amp;rsquo;t actually see the web browser being driven by the script, which is handy to see during demos. So we&amp;rsquo;ll do that, and then we have to set up the context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So browser, oops, new context. And then we set up a page. The first one is go to the homepage. The second one is to view a product. Third, add the product to the cart. Fourth is go to the cart and then last, I want to check out. So to do that, I&amp;rsquo;ve already defined the browser context in page. Now I need to do &lt;code&gt;page.goto http://ecommerce.k6.io&lt;/code&gt; and I will also want to wait for &lt;code&gt;waitUntil: networkidle&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great. I wanted to add some sort of check to make sure that I&amp;rsquo;ve actually gotten to a place so, let&amp;rsquo;s open up DevTools here and I wanna make sure that some results are displayed. I don&amp;rsquo;t necessarily need, you know 1-12 of 17 but, I want this one. Okay, so I&amp;rsquo;ll also say &lt;code&gt;page.waitForSelector&lt;/code&gt; and that&amp;rsquo;ll be this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then let&amp;rsquo;s do a screenshot, because we just for, just in case we wanna debug later we wanna make sure that we will be able to have a look at at this screenshot to see what exactly went wrong. And I&amp;rsquo;ll put that in screenshots and I&amp;rsquo;ll say &lt;code&gt;01_homepage&lt;/code&gt;. Then let&amp;rsquo;s do a sleep. And I always like to do the random one. Random, and let&amp;rsquo;s say it from zero to four. This time I&amp;rsquo;m doing the custom k6 version &lt;code&gt;browser.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For browser-based tests, I find it much more useful to actually see what&amp;rsquo;s going on rather than to look at the output. Because as you can see there are all sorts of errors here and I believe that they&amp;rsquo;re actually application errors so they can be a little bit misleading. It looks like that happened but let&amp;rsquo;s just look at the screenshots. Screenshot, yeah. That, that loaded fine. So we can continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next step is to view a product. Okay, let&amp;rsquo;s go back here. This time I want to click this thing. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter which, which item it is. I&amp;rsquo;ll just choose the first one. Looks like this is the actual product link. So let element = page. And this is where we actually paste the selector which is what I got from DevTools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we haven&amp;rsquo;t done anything yet with it. We want to actually click it. So &lt;code&gt;element.click&lt;/code&gt;. After that though, I&amp;rsquo;m going to want to make sure that we get to the right page. So, let&amp;rsquo;s see what happens when we click it. What can we look for? I guess we can look for this add to cart button, cuz if the item didn&amp;rsquo;t show up then we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to add it to the cart. So let&amp;rsquo;s grab that. Button, button name is add to cart. Copy that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then I&amp;rsquo;ll say &lt;code&gt;page.waitForSelector&lt;/code&gt;, the selector with a button name there. Take another screenshot because why not? I&amp;rsquo;ll say &lt;code&gt;02_view-product&lt;/code&gt; and then another sleep. From here it was pretty much more of the same. Here&amp;rsquo;s me scripting adding the product to the cart, viewing the cart and then finally going to the checkout page. And here&amp;rsquo;s what happened when I played it all back. Here it is going to the homepage, and then clicking on the first product, and then adding that product to the cart, and then clicking view cart, and then proceeding to checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best part about this is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to choose between the browser test and the protocol test. They&amp;rsquo;re both in k6 and written in JavaScript so you could include them in the same script. You can use stages to schedule when one starts and when one ends. You can change the load profile, add checks and thresholds. And you can also use all of the output options that are available for protocol tests for the browser tests as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The catch is that xk6-browser is really new. We&amp;rsquo;ve just announced it. It&amp;rsquo;s still in beta so you are likely to come across more than a few bugs. However, I&amp;rsquo;d still recommend that you give it a go. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with it and I&amp;rsquo;ve found it more than serviceable for a lot of my use cases. Plus it&amp;rsquo;s just really cool to be able to test front-end performance along with back-end performance in the same testing script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for watching. I will put a link to the xk6-browser repository below and happy testing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was a Roam Research power user, a Believer, and investor before I discovered Obsidian. Here&amp;rsquo;s why I still ended up choosing Obsidian over Roam as my personal knowledge management tool of choice. My goal with this video is to share with you my reasons for making the choice that I did, not to judge you or anyone else who disagrees. In the end, we all have to decide for ourselves what tool fits best in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Load testing on the cloud definitely has its advantages, but what if you need to load test behind a firewall? Here to talk about using private load zones in k6 are k6 CTO Pawel Suwala and k6 Backend Lead Samuel Regandell. Private load zones are a new feature of k6 Cloud that will allow you to run load tests against applications that are not publicly accessible and also use your own AWS account to generate the load.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.postman.com/&#34;&gt;Postman&lt;/a&gt; is a near-ubiquitous tool for anyone doing API testing, and many teams use collections to create and organize complicated test suites. However, there&amp;rsquo;s one thing that Postman isn&amp;rsquo;t good at: load testing. That&amp;rsquo;s where k6 comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/timhaselaars&#34;&gt;Tim Haselaars&lt;/a&gt; joined k6 Office Hours to talk to &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/javaducky&#34;&gt;Paul Balogh&lt;/a&gt; and me about how to use Postman collections to run load tests using k6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone and welcome to another k6 Office Hours. I am Nicole van der Hoeven and today I have two guests. One of them may already be familiar to you, Paul Balogh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And our special guest is Tim Haselaars. Tim, would you like to introduce yourself?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, hi, nice to meet you Nicole and Paul. I am Tim Haselaars. I&amp;rsquo;m living in Belgium. I&amp;rsquo;m a product manager, and I work at the marketing automation company called Selligent. I have a passion for APIs. I love music, I&amp;rsquo;m a DJ as well in my spare time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if I still have some spare time left, I like to contribute to a number of open source projects, which the Postman-to-k6 is one of the projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on together with the k6 team in the past. So that&amp;rsquo;s a bit of why I&amp;rsquo;m here today. So nice to meet you both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s a pretty big if though, if you have time, you&amp;rsquo;re a DJ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a hobby thing, but I&amp;rsquo;m really proud of it actually, because I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing a lot, and there&amp;rsquo;s one festival in Europe, Tomorrowland, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing it each year for the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s a small stage, but I&amp;rsquo;m really proud of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, that is awesome. You should be proud of that. I think that kind of makes sense, because product management is such a multidisciplinary role as well. Like, it&amp;rsquo;s not all technical, and it&amp;rsquo;s not all people skills. It&amp;rsquo;s a mixture of both, and a lot of other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s also what keeps it interesting, at least for me, what keeps it interesting, actually, so yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what do you typically do in your current job, and what does it have to do with k6?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, in my current job, I&amp;rsquo;m a product manager, so we have a digital platform, marketing automation platform and I&amp;rsquo;m spearheading the API renewal program. So we had a number of APIs in our company which customers use to connect and exchange data with marketing data, and we&amp;rsquo;re renewing that, and performance is critical, because we have a number of really big customers in Europe, or , the Dutch luxury brand, and we talk about huge volume, so our APIs has to be scalable, and performant, and we use k6 to guarantee that we keep them up to standard, actually. So that&amp;rsquo;s what we do. And my role there is to make sure the teams, I help with the API design, and I check with the teams, and I document stuff together with the teams, we try to do that. So what I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about is also my experience with k6 and the way we use it at the company a bit more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cool, so how did you first start, what made you start to use k6? Did you try other things before that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. In a previous job, a couple of years ago, I was working at a hosting company, and they were doing a, there was an anniversary of the national lottery, it&amp;rsquo;s like the lottery company, so it had,, they expected a lot of visitors to the website, and we wanted to make sure the hosting was up to par, and it was able to handle the volumes. And I tried to test it, performance test it, load test it, and I used Jmeter, and the experience was, I struggled a lot with it. And I started browsing for another solution, and then I hit, I found k6. text was really nice. You could really quickly start nice documentation, and that&amp;rsquo;s how I rolled into k6. And then I shifted jobs, and at the current job, I said we have to use k6, because it&amp;rsquo;s so much easier than using JMeter. You can script it, you can automate it, and that&amp;rsquo;s it, yeah. I used it once, and never looked back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So nice, with the automation, did you put hook that in your CI/CD pipeline as well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes we do. I can, I have a diagram. Like, I&amp;rsquo;m really proud of it. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m a bit, how do you say, biased by it, but I&amp;rsquo;m really proud of what we&amp;rsquo;ve achieved with the automation aspect actually. And we came from a far away, a far place, but now, we have a nice automated flow, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which I hope I can showcase a bit later on in the talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;d love to see it. And do you use k6 Cloud or k6 OSS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had used Cloud in the past, I think right now, my team are mostly using the OSS version of it. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why. I have to check with them, actually, but I think we had a number of dashboards set up, and they were a bit detailed to what we need, or what I needed at least, and that&amp;rsquo;s why I think we stick with, for now we stick with the OSS version of k6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, awesome. So I guess people might be wondering, seeing the title of this video, what Postman has to do with either Selligent or k6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, actually that&amp;rsquo;s a story I want to tell, how did we ended up with k6, and the whole story. So what typically happens if you start developing an API is you build your API, and then you want to test it, you want to play around with it. You want to experiment with it. And the first thing that you do as a non-technical user like, I take Postman. Postman is an application where you can model your request in a nice tool, and then you can just fire them. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to a curl script, or you don&amp;rsquo;t have to use any CI tools for making API calls. So that was the logical step. So we build an API, I want to experiment, play around with it, so we ended up using Postman for it. But maintaining Postman is not so easy when you go for automation flows. And then when you want to take a step further, if you want to do performance tests, that&amp;rsquo;s another a thing. And yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s why I think we went from what we did to Postman just the next, as a first phase. But sooner, the more end points we have, the more we wanted to test and the more we wanted to play around with it, the bigger everything became. So that&amp;rsquo;s why, yeah, we wanted to make it an automation level and make it a bit more streamlined so that the manual work would go down a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like you have a fan out in the viewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I like to make things visual, because it helps me visualize my thoughts and everything. So yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve used Postman before. I think it&amp;rsquo;s almost ubiquitous now for anyone who&amp;rsquo;s doing any sort of API testing. I think at some point people would&amp;rsquo;ve used Postman just because it is very easy to get started, but I do, I have also run across some of the issues that you describe when you&amp;rsquo;re scaling up, when you have a very complex test suite or you want to have one, it is, I think I personally still like the scripting approach of being able to have the full, you know, being able to have condition loops and that sort of thing. There&amp;rsquo;s still a lot more flexibility when, when you&amp;rsquo;re just dealing with pure code. But I know that I think it was, I mean, relatively recently when I started using Postman, it was just firing off requests, and it was like a single user kind of thing, but what are the features available for performance testing for Postman, you alluded to it, them, and you said that maybe they&amp;rsquo;re not, they weren&amp;rsquo;t exactly what you were looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, no. Maybe I should quickly show a bit how I&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work with it if that&amp;rsquo;s okay for you. Okay, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna showcase my, so well, just as a reference, I created fake endpoint and I was set up a Postman collection. So what you do typically in Postman is you have an API that you define. In our case, I created a k6 office hour CRM API, just plain and simple where you can see, yeah, you could see some context you potentially want to interview in the future, and you model them. So you have your endpoint, you just put them in. You say, it&amp;rsquo;s a get post, put, whatever you need, and then you can just fire it and it&amp;rsquo;s response. And so this is an actual API request happening behind the scenes. That&amp;rsquo;s really nice because as a non-technical user, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to have any technical expertise. You just enter the endpoint percent and you&amp;rsquo;re up and running. But it also has some nice features if you want to make complex things, like you said, Nicole, if you want to use variables, because you might want to experiment with your API endpoints in different environments, so you can use variables. That&amp;rsquo;s what they use with the curly brackets here. So it&amp;rsquo;s a base URL. So I can shift around so if I want to switch, I have potentially two environments. I have a production one and a dev one. I can easily switch between them and then the variables will also switch along. That&amp;rsquo;s a really nice thing to do with Postman. The next thing, what I really like about Postman is that you can use it to create cruds and you can create flows with it. So it&amp;rsquo;s really straightforward. So if you say, I want to create one item and then I want to use the item in my detailed call in my, so I have all leads, create a lead and I want to get the leads, so this is the end point, you could just define it as a variable. You could say, I want to, that this lead ID can be used to fetch the right lead ID. So if you create one, that&amp;rsquo;s the body, I do a post request. And what happens is you get a new ID back, which is unique because I just created a new contact in our CRM application. And you can use scripting in Postman to say, ah, there is a data response, and I&amp;rsquo;m gonna store that response in my lead ID variable. So it allows some scripting within a GUI which is really nice, and it also allows you to define tests. Like I want to check what&amp;rsquo;s the response. It should be 200. You can define a Postman test. They use a bit of assertion, kind of syntax for that. So what started out as something really straightforward, I wanted to just test and play around with it, experiment of the endpoints. It became much more. And we started building like a full suite out of Postman, in Postman itself, a test suite. And that&amp;rsquo;s really cool because as a non-technical user, you could just share this collection with anybody on the team and they could just run the same request and play around with it. You can even pass it on to partners or colleagues or customers, when they say, when they want to use your API, you can just say, ah, you can use a Postman collection to play around with it. And another nice thing about Postman is that you can run scenarios, like I said, and you can run them at scale. So right now I&amp;rsquo;m doing get leads, creating a lead. Then I&amp;rsquo;m gonna fetch the lead that I just created. So I created Elon Musk as a user. I can update that one as well. So I can put a body and touch and I can even delete it. So if I would run this in a cycle, I would test actually the whole flow of a typical crud operation. You can fetch one, create one, edit one, delete one, and then it&amp;rsquo;s back to normal again. And so lemme talk about, yeah, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Sorry, I just wanted to, sorry to interrupt, but would it be possible to try and zoom here in this one to see if you can make it just a little bit bigger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] Okay, something like that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Yes. Thank you. Sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] No, no, no worries. So what you can do Postman, if we talk about test automation, you can just say, I want to run all these, these API requests in the sequence, like they&amp;rsquo;re organized here, and you can just run them. So if you run them, you see you put in some test, this one is a success, success, creation successful. And so actually testing if your API&amp;rsquo;s responding as you expected, but you cannot test it at scale or at high volume. The only thing you could do in Postman is if I press run, I could define a number of iterations. So if I would say, I want to do 10 iterations, I&amp;rsquo;m just gonna run them now, so you can see, you can see it just creates blocks. but while I&amp;rsquo;m talking, it took to run all these 10, five times 10 requests, it took me, let&amp;rsquo;s say one minute to run. So we cannot really test at scale if, that&amp;rsquo;s not the use case of Postman. The use case of Postman is to experiment with request, do some testing on some validation of the response and the inputs are okay and that&amp;rsquo;s about it. So I needed something more if you want to do that scale. So while I discovered k6, k6 has this nice scripting language, you could define&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Tim before you, sorry. Before you move on, we do have a question. Chaitra asks, can you share this collection please, just to get along with Postman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] Okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Is there a way that you could share, make that public or something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can, I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried it, but I guess if I click share and I could, can I create a JSON link? Maybe could JSON link, update the link, maybe like that? I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried this actually before either so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Awesome, we&amp;rsquo;re learning in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Paul] Exactly. No pressure, no pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] Oh, should I put it in the comments, or how would I do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Yeah, sure. That would be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Paul] Yeah, otherwise I was gonna say we could probably put something together too for after, you know, the presentation if someone wants to access that, if there&amp;rsquo;s no issue with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll put that in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] So I was asked as well from the k6 team to update our blog post about Postman and k6. So what I&amp;rsquo;m gonna do after this session is going to review the blog post that they have already on the website and then update it with maybe some content that I&amp;rsquo;m talking about in this show here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] And we also got a comment from Jim Munro who says Postman is definitely not designed for load testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] No, no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] And that&amp;rsquo;s what it seemed like. So it seemed like you could only do iterations. Is that right? You can&amp;rsquo;t set, you can&amp;rsquo;t have more threads or users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] No, that&amp;rsquo;s it. So the only thing you can do is you can run a sequence and you can run it in a number of iterations, but you can, you can&amp;rsquo;t define how many users, you can&amp;rsquo;t define how long iteration, you can define sleep, but that&amp;rsquo;s difficult. So Postman is great for what it is. It&amp;rsquo;s great for testing some of your contracts of your API, is great for experimenting with your API, and really kickstart using your API, but if you want to do volume, to test the volume at scale, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t recommend Postman at all. But that&amp;rsquo;s also a bit the problem, because you already spent a lot of time making a nice collection, preparing it, grooming it, updating all the time. If you then want to go to k6, you would have to rewrite everything. So if you, this is how k6 syntax looks so you can define your iterations. You know this better than me actually. And you can just use a get request. And you can script your request. You can also check it. So that&amp;rsquo;s the same as you would do in the Postman where you test your response. You could check if it&amp;rsquo;s a 200. But if you have a complex scripts, you can, they become really large to maintain and to keep them up to date. And that&amp;rsquo;s what I struggled with because it felt like I&amp;rsquo;m reinventing the wheel. So I made a diagram out of it just to explain it. So if you have an API and you have to update it, you would have to really update your collection and say, every time something changes an endpoint was added or a property was changed, you needed to update, go into the Postman collection, manually correct everything, extend it, and yeah, keep it up to date. But if you would go to k6, you have twice the work, actually. You have your API that&amp;rsquo;s changing. So you need to update your collection. You need to update your k6 scripts. So if you have five endpoints, that&amp;rsquo;s doable. But if you have 20 endpoints for one API, that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of work to keep them in sync, because this is a moving target, but it forces you to keep in sync to other moving targets because you want to be able to experiment and test them, contract, and you also want to test them at scale with the load. And I was looking really for a way, like how can I leverage this nicely prepared Postman collection and use for k6 scripts? And that&amp;rsquo;s what I, when I ended up with this scenario where you have your API, I update my post collection, I want to generate a k6 script. And I was looking around like, how can I do that? And I found on the k6 website, I found some blog items on, on how that they provided a Postman to k6 converter. And that really triggered me and I started playing around with it. And I really, really liked it. So it gives me all the flexibility of modeling everything in Postman, preparing the whole flow. So if I want to run it in sequence, I could do that. But then it also converted it into a k6 script where I had no maintenance on it, and that was really nice. And when I found the Postman k6 package, like a year ago or something, the purpose of that was to kickstart your k6 experience. And I said, but you can do much more with it. You could even fully automate it with some parameters because the first time I converted my collection, it had like 20 endpoints. I still needed to do add some minor things, I needed to add some k6 specific stuff to it, like how many iterations do I want to do, is there certain parameters I want to add that are not by default converted over. So I said, okay, what can I do to make it even better? And I don&amp;rsquo;t have to touch the k6 script anymore. So the first time that you converted it, I had to modify it still. So each time that I would do this kind of a behavior, the API changes, I need to update my Postman collection and I needed to update my k6 script. I want to, my ideal world would be, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to touch the k6 script at all. I just convert it and I was able to run it in one go. And I can show you how it works, because it&amp;rsquo;s really straightforward in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;rsquo;s okay, you can export your collection&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Yeah, sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] So if you do export, you can just say export and you download a JSON file and you can do the same thing with your own environment. So if you want to have your test environment and you want to also convert them you can because you can also export these from Postman. And what you end up with, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna close this one, you end up with two JSON files. So as you can see, it&amp;rsquo;s the k6 office hours. It has some syntax in it, like the test scripts are there, the endpoints are there, the way you connect to them. So all the request information is in this configuration, in the environment file. You can find all your variables that you have defined. So let me just now showcase it. Sorry, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna, this one. So if you run the Postman-to-k6 converter, it expects actually two things. You define an input, my Postman collection, and you define an output. So if I would run this, just closely watch what happens there, it does some things behind the scenes, and once it&amp;rsquo;s finished, you would get, actually, if things go well, let&amp;rsquo;s see if it&amp;rsquo;s there, you would get this. Yeah, that that&amp;rsquo;s the goal of CLI. It should be fast. You get the k6 script. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go over that later on, and you get this library folder. The library folder, what it is is because the converter, Postman uses number of functions, some methods that are not mapping exactly towards k6. So once this package, it adds some additional functionality that Postman uses. Like it uses low dash and some encryption, stuff like that, and it just adds the libraries there. So if you would do this manually, you would also have to include the libraries, but it does it for you. It includes all the libraries. And it&amp;rsquo;s actually a wrap around the, let&amp;rsquo;s go for the SHIM quickly. If it&amp;rsquo;s not clear what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to explain, stop me, Nicole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Yeah, but we can also answer this question from Carlos Ramirez. You can also integrate, well, not a question, a comment. You can also integrate your process using the Postman API key to request information about your collection and environment. And he also adds, oh, no, sorry, this is from Chaitra Nanjesh, this is interesting, because we use k6 in Tesco, says load test, and I think we can try this to see if it works for us. So people are already liking what you&amp;rsquo;re sharing Tim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s the goal, That&amp;rsquo;s also why I liked it actually&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Do you also do what Carlos was suggesting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] Yes, and I even go a step further, but that&amp;rsquo;s, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna come back to that later. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna showcase how we do the Full Monty in the end, actually. I&amp;rsquo;m building up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Awesome. Sorry, people are excited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m also excited, so I hope that I&amp;rsquo;m coming across properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] You&amp;rsquo;re doing great, don&amp;rsquo;t worry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] Okay. Just for reference, you have to think of this Postman-to-k6 thing as it&amp;rsquo;s wrapping Postman functions and k6 functions and combining them in one place. So it&amp;rsquo;s abstracting away the k6 part and it matches with the Postman stuff. So that&amp;rsquo;s what it does behind the scenes. So if you see, if you do an execute request, which is an, it&amp;rsquo;s a function actually, behind the scenes, it just does the HTTP dot request, which is a k6 function. So it wraps a lot of things together, and I think if I would go to execute test, you would also see it uses the k6 check function. Just for reference, this is the wrapping part. This is all not so relevant. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to care about it. What&amp;rsquo;s relevant is what&amp;rsquo;s being generated for you. So it says on top, it&amp;rsquo;s an autogenerated file here. It does some imports. It imports also k6 related items and it sets default options. By default, it says maximum redirects. And then it does some strange things which are not k6 related, but that&amp;rsquo;s typically what the package does. That&amp;rsquo;s the wrap that you see. It defines a collection with a base URL, and then you will see that my group is there, I have my request get all leads. It showcases the URL. It showcases that it does a test here. So everything that you had defined in your Postman collection, sorry&amp;hellip; Get all tests and you could see the test here. It&amp;rsquo;s translated into a k6 kind of syntax and it&amp;rsquo;s ready to be used. And you see all the requests on here, all ready to be used. It even matches a response codes that you can match to a variable in Postman. You could do anything. The body is there that I inserted that you can create. So if I were now just say k6, sorry, k6 run k6 scripts. Oh, dunno know why this is happening? Give it a second to start up. There you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] So I haven&amp;rsquo;t touched anything, I just took my Postman collection, converted it with the converter that we built a while ago together with k6 and then you can see the tests there. So I created a number of tests. Postman expects to, the response is expected to be 200. I get all the data. My average is my group duration because you also have a group there. So if you have 20 endpoints, you will test 20 endpoints, but I don&amp;rsquo;t need to write any k6. So I only do my maintenance for, my maintenance only happens in here. I only have to maintain my Postman collection and my k6 gets generated out of them. So that&amp;rsquo;s really nice thing here. Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s the library that we&amp;rsquo;re using. No, that&amp;rsquo;s not, that&amp;rsquo;s not my library actually. I think it&amp;rsquo;s moved to&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Paul] Uh-oh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Hope this is the right one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Paul] Yeah, we gotta update our show notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Yeah, we do. Oh, with the API deck one. Sorry about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] No worries. I think I made a pool request a while ago, so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Ah, I see. Okay, I will update the description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] But I, just to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Can you also post, Tim, the link?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ll post it. Of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] But it&amp;rsquo;s really cool. Maybe cool&amp;rsquo;s not the right word because the package supports a number of things so that you can even tweak the output even further. So by default, I just say, give me the Postman collection and generate a k6 and it would work. But if you want to automate this on a higher level, need to do work for automation, you wanted to tweak some things. Maybe I want to play around with some k6 parameters, or I wanted to do something else, or I want to exclude stuff, or I want to include my environment because, if you see here, there is no, there&amp;rsquo;s only my base url, but I have a lot of variables I want to use in my Postman collection that I already defined. I have login information. I have some Postman base URL. So you can take it even further because now you just get a script, but it&amp;rsquo;s just, the script is already addressed. So you can take it step further. So for example, if you would say, I want to increase the number of iterations, you could just say like this. You have this parameter, says iteration 10. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to convert it. There we go. And if you see my script now has options already set at 10. That&amp;rsquo;s nice. That&amp;rsquo;s handy because you want to automate this, of course. And you can even go, take a step further. I want to include my Postman environment variables. So I&amp;rsquo;m gonna, there&amp;rsquo;s also a parameter for that. So you can pass some environment variables. So you can even pass some global variables. This is typically Postman, but you can just take the ones that Postman provides, export them and use them. So if I now do this kind of thing, so this is my file with my Postman variables, like I showed. Let&amp;rsquo;s do this again. And here, you&amp;rsquo;ll see all my variables that were exposed in my environment are now available for my k6 script to be used in automation workflows. So that&amp;rsquo;s really nice, but I can even take it a step further. What if I have special k6 related parameters? I&amp;rsquo;m just gonna copy paste them here for the sake of the demo, but I might want to define my iterations or my maximum redirects because k6 offers a lot of parameter options. Like I want to use cookies. I want to use headers. The number of redirects. I want to set some text. I want to define a timeout. All these k6 related parameters, I want to make sure that my automation flow was able to process them because I want to run the script without touching it. So I want to be able to just say, take these parameters for this pipeline, these parameters are applicable for production. So you could switch environments. For example, what we do is we have different test scenarios defined. So if we go for a small test, we run it like this, we define stages and thresholds. Well, if we want to really do performance testing, we have different ones. So these options, we use them to pass them along to the pipeline. So I could do something again with the generation part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Question from Sri. Is it one environment at a time only?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] Yes, because what you generate is what you inject the script. So it, you would then have to generate a second script, but that&amp;rsquo;s really easy to do because you would just say, I want to have, for example, just showcasing it here, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna take this script is for the second test stage. You just run it and then you get a second script next to it. So you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about it. You don&amp;rsquo;t think about one script. You just fork it as much as you need with different configuration options defined that you would use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Yeah, and Sri, I wanted to also add here that with k6, you can have, you can test more than one environment at a time. What Tim is showing here is that for, because of the way that the that Postman treats these collections separately, every environment is separate. And so the converter also converts them to separate k6 scripts. However, once they&amp;rsquo;re in k6 script format, once it&amp;rsquo;s all JavaScript, you could use k6 executors and scenarios to run them simultaneously, if that&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;d prefer or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] So in this example, what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, I&amp;rsquo;m going to pass on my K6 parameters as a JSON file so that I can put them in a Git somewhere. And if I then just say, press go, you will see that it also just updates this option spot on the top. There we go. So you will see, I have defined it to be in this case five virtual users, 10 iterations, maximum redirects, and just adds it on top. So I can switch around in my pipeline without touching anything. I just prepare everything, and then it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of defining which command I should to run and it just does it for me. So that&amp;rsquo;s really handy and it really makes automation a lot easier in that regard. And there&amp;rsquo;s one thing I really like. It&amp;rsquo;s a small thing, actually. Now it generates one big file. So everything is in this one big file, all the request, it&amp;rsquo;s doable if you have like me, for example, four requests or five requests. But if you have like 20 endpoint or 20 requests, it&amp;rsquo;s a huge file. And to handle that, you can just pass along one parameter. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s commonly used a lot, but I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of it. It&amp;rsquo;s called a separate parameter. So what happens now? The options are there. The request configuration is there. But you just get this in your k6 script. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure which one, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna remove one because otherwise I might get confused. There we go. You get this, and this is actually, it splits all your requests in a separate folder like you would see them in Postman and each request would be separated from the rest. And that makes it really easy. If you want to test something specifically, if you would have one script, it would run everything. But now I can just comment out, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do the create, I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do the update and delete. I only want to test to get all leads. You just say k6, k6 run k6 script. Give it a second to warm up. There you go. It will only test that request that I defined. So if your 20 endpoints, your k6 script has been generated for you will have 20 lines and all your requests will be nicely separated from each other. So you can even say, I want to tweak it a bit, or you have all flexibility then, while if you don&amp;rsquo;t use a separate parameter, it just generates one file with everything in it. Do I make sense still?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Yes you do. But there&amp;rsquo;s a comment here from one of our engineers who wrote that initial blog post that you may be updating, Mostafa said last time you wrote an article about it, it needed a few changes to make things work, so well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] Yeah. Yes, that was one of my first VRs that I did. I wanted to make separate flow over pretty much everything. And there&amp;rsquo;s one final thing I want to showcase for, with the k6 part, is now you have to really, like all these parameters, they become very long and difficult. You could also just define them as a JSON file and just pass them along. And now you can just define the one file, put the main Git, and then you could just say, I want, this is the output, my environment. You can even define that it uses a handle summary, or you can add request tagging on top of it. And if you do it like that, you get, you just have to do one parameter, one command, actually. So if I do it like this, you see, it just says, this is my input file. I&amp;rsquo;ve defined an options file, which I referred to. And if I then just do it, it would take all these parameters that I&amp;rsquo;ve defined and you would get, again, everything nicely generated for you. All the requests are there and it even added the handle summary thing on top of that, which is something&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Oh nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] So everything is there. And so this is the automation flow that&amp;rsquo;s really powerful because otherwise you would have to add, if you want to have a summary, you have to add a modified file. But now I just define one configuration file, I define my parameters, I define whatever I need. Just run it, and my script, I don&amp;rsquo;t need to touch it. I can just say, okay, k6 run k6 script. And you would see that it generates, yeah, it generates a test. It does, I think five or 10 iterations. There we go. And it doesn&amp;rsquo;t open anymore. It generates the JSON file. If I close my, quickly here, you would see a summary report is here. So it just, yeah, there is no manual work anymore to run k6, just keep your equipment collection up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Paul] And you&amp;rsquo;re helping folks out with your example here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] Yeah, okay, great. Okay, that&amp;rsquo;s in summary, the things that I want to showcase about the converter. There are some nice things added since the last releases from the k6 team. So I added some, requested and changed some things, and I&amp;rsquo;m really happy with it. It works flawless at the moment in our organization actually. So I&amp;rsquo;m really happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Yeah, it seems really, I think I tried this initially, like when Mostafa was saying, there are a few things that you, you had to get done, but this seems way slicker, and it seems like you&amp;rsquo;ve really focused on making it automatic so that don&amp;rsquo;t, there is no manual intervention, which totally makes sense in a CI/CD pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] Yes, correct. And I wanted to put my effort on the Postman and the management of the Postman collection, because that was a tool where we were all working on and maintaining it. And I wanted to keep the workload on k6 as low as possible. And I think we succeeded it quite well on that regard. There are some things that are not available out of the box. Like you cannot do the send request. You cannot set next request. But what I did add was, what I&amp;rsquo;m also really proud of, the dynamic functions from Postman. You could just add any, pretty much any generated stuff. Let&amp;rsquo;s see if it shows, if it works like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] There&amp;rsquo;s also some nice comments for you. There&amp;rsquo;s Gertjan De Wilde, who says, Go Tim. There&amp;rsquo;s Pepe Cano as well from k6 chiming in with his support. James is saying nice to see this getting the love it deserves, much better experience. And Charly is saying, Very useful tool, congratulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Lots of love in the comments for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Paul] Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] Okay. But honesty, we took it a even a level further, but maybe I should, maybe there are, if there are other questions we should talk about or not, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] I&amp;rsquo;m interested in this. So what were you saying, the dynamic part that you added parameters?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] Let&amp;rsquo;s see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] I mean, you also don&amp;rsquo;t have to demonstrate everything. Can we just like acknowledge the fact that Tim who doesn&amp;rsquo;t even work for k6 or Postman volunteered to do like a live demo about this. So that&amp;rsquo;s awesome. Don&amp;rsquo;t feel like you have to show us everything. You can just talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, Postman really provides this nice, what they call dynamic variables. And so it&amp;rsquo;s, this is a screenshot of it. So if you use curly brackets, it&amp;rsquo;s random, and then you can say, I want the full name, I want the bank account or anything that uses Faker behind the scenes, and you can make dummy data out of it. So that&amp;rsquo;s really handy if you want to really make, yeah, realistic data without having to use for loops or anything, just put in the variable. And that was not fully supported in Postman to k6. So we brought in that support as well to make sure that you could have the full functionality of the dynamic variables attached to that. So yeah, there are a number of things we did since the last release of it, and I think dynamic variables was in much demand at that moment. There you go. Yeah, and I&amp;rsquo;m really happy for Mostafa, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how to pronounce it correctly, because I think he was one of the first ones who pointed out in his blog post about functionality. So thank you for pointing it out to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, now that I think about it, I should have asked Mostafa to be here too. Oh, I missed that opportunity. Sorry about that Mostafa. That&amp;rsquo;s so good about the dynamic variables, because that&amp;rsquo;s one of the things that you have to think about when you shift from just a purely automization mode, like automated testing mode to load testing is that you can&amp;rsquo;t, you then have to start thinking about the data that you&amp;rsquo;re sending too, because if you&amp;rsquo;re trying to get realistic response times it could trigger caching on the service side if you&amp;rsquo;re just requesting the same thing. So yeah, totally makes sense. k6 can already, you can already import faker with k6, so great, great job for putting that together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, no, that&amp;rsquo;s very cool though, but yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s like, you can use Postman for your user, your UI, your, you know, your development environment and do all this stuff and then even goes through there and generates some random data. So, yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s cool. Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, go on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But maybe I&amp;rsquo;m gonna talk first before I want to show the final piece of what we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, just, just quickly, I just wanted to ask about the limitations of this approach that you see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all functions of Postman are supported. So that&amp;rsquo;s the downside of it actually. But for the use is that that we are using it, we have everything covered. Like you have the, the dynamic variables, you have the environment variables, you can define k6 parameters. Yeah, there was nothing stopping us. I think if you want to do complex scenarios and you want to do if-else situations, there it&amp;rsquo;s not suited for. That&amp;rsquo;s the same problem you would have in Postman. It would be difficult to make these if-else conditions in Postman as well. So that&amp;rsquo;s, if you do simple tests, functional tests in Postman, you can really easily port them to k6 and then you have performance tests end points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in the spirit of the whole free and open software. I mean, do you have issues where like you&amp;rsquo;re looking for help? Is there any gaps that you&amp;rsquo;re still looking to fill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some bugs I cannot reproduce at the moment, something with XML conversions, but right now it&amp;rsquo;s feels quite feature complete. I haven&amp;rsquo;t added that much, actually. The base was already there by the k6 team members who built the initial library. So I just added some sugar coating on top to make the automation flows much smoother and less manual work, or linked actually. But if people have great ideas, I think they should just make a PR and add it to the package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, did you want to show us something else?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I want to show how we ran a step further even, because yeah, if you update your API and then you have to update your Postman collection, it then generates a nice k6. But we also use openAPI as a documentation tool where we document and design our API. So every change that you do on your API, you need to add them to your API, and then you, so you still have to maintain not one output, the Postman, but you also have to update your documentation. And I want to flip that around. I want to make the API documentation leading, generate the Postman collection out of it and generate out of the Postman collection, a k6 suite. So that as a product manager, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to maintain all these documents anymore. I just maintain one thing, and that&amp;rsquo;s my openAPI and my team or our team then only just need to develop the application itself. And it&amp;rsquo;s called spec driven approach. It&amp;rsquo;s nothing new, but I&amp;rsquo;m a really big fan of it and I&amp;rsquo;m a really, yeah, we introduced it a year ago and it solved so much and it brought so much quality on the company level, in our documentation, in our test suites. So that&amp;rsquo;s something I want to share as well, because it&amp;rsquo;s so valuable once you get how it works and if the right tools and properties, you can really do it. And this is actually where we are right now. I can also demo how it works. So we have, I&amp;rsquo;m managing an openAPI documentation. We use the formatting and we validate it if it&amp;rsquo;s valid. And then we use a generated one. And from the generated one, we generate documentation. So public documentation, stop lights, just like whatever you call it, we generate a Postman collection that we can share with the customers and we run contract tests, we run soak tests and we run smoke tests all based on this openAPI documentation. So, and again, there&amp;rsquo;s no no contact or no changes involved. We just, we managed the spec on its own and it&amp;rsquo;s really, really something powerful and useful. And I can quickly show how it would work actually if you&amp;rsquo;re interested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Yes, but before you do, a wild Mostafa appears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How awesome is that? Let&amp;rsquo;s just say hello to Mostafa, who just joined last minute since he was already in the comments anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice to meet you. And I&amp;rsquo;m grateful that you wrote the blog post so many, so many months or years ago, so thank you for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, yeah, I really felt the need that we needed this article, so that&amp;rsquo;s why I wrote it in the first place. And then, yeah, I found a lot of issues that you solved, and thank you, it was a great job you did, and well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you. And thank you for putting out the 90% of it. I said I only had to put in the sugar on the top of it and the cherry on the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, no, no, no, that&amp;rsquo;s not true, that&amp;rsquo;s not true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostafa&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first place just to clarify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, Mostafa while you&amp;rsquo;re here can you quickly introduce who you are and why we&amp;rsquo;ve randomly invited you onto the stream?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course. Okay, so I am a backend developer at k6. I&amp;rsquo;m almost three years with k6, like it was called Load Impact before being renamed completely to k6, and now Grafana. I&amp;rsquo;ve been a developer advocate when the first like idea came into place that we want to have a developer advocacy program. And yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a developer advocate for a year and then came back to back it. So I worked with lots of these tools and tried to help others because like, there were no other resources available. Like there was this read-me on the project and that was it. No mention of it anywhere. Only the hidden knowledge of everyone inside the company of how to use this tool, but nobody knew without outside the company. So tried to learn it from others, specifically, Pepe, thanks for that, from here. And I tried to write that blog post and try to share the knowledge. So that&amp;rsquo;s basically it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, so we also got a comment: Great with the diagram. Can you share this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course I can. Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;ll do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right, I guess that&amp;rsquo;s our cue to head back. Please continue, Tim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna, I&amp;rsquo;m just gonna showcase it, and then I hope everybody will really appreciate and see the power that it brings actually. So, okay, so maybe start with the beginning. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna close my screens a bit to clean it up. So I have this openAPI spec that I, it&amp;rsquo;s just a copy of what we just described. So this is how it looks, this is documentation using Docly. You can see it&amp;rsquo;s the k6 office hours CRM application. You can see the list in there. You can see the create, the get. So it&amp;rsquo;s just the definition of what the API would look like. This is the documentation part of it. So I&amp;rsquo;m using now two tools. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna use Portman as another package that I built together with API Deck and make an API Deck where we can convert the openAPI to Postman, and from the Postman, you can generate a k6 one. And that&amp;rsquo;s really nice because you only need two commands, one source file, and you have two outputs out of the box. So that&amp;rsquo;s really powerful. I find it powerful at least. So I&amp;rsquo;m gonna take my commands correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So If it&amp;rsquo;s okay, can you, I&amp;rsquo;m not, I&amp;rsquo;m not up to speed with Portman. So it creates a Postman collection already given openAPI, is something in openAPI specification?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was, Postman built a patch like Mostafa, k6 build a patch where you can convert from Postman to k6, and Postman build a Postman where you can convert from openAPI to Postman. And when I found out, I said, that&amp;rsquo;s amazing. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to maintain a Postman collection anymore, but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t, it was missing some functionality, and the major thing that I was missing, it was just creating the request than Postman, but not the tests. It was not handling the tests of it. It was not assigning variables. It was just taking the Postman request and converting them into openAPI requests, into Postman. So you still needed to maintain and modify them. And I said, it has to be, because an openAPI documentation or specification, it describes everything, the request type, the body, the properties, if you do it properly, you have all, everything in one go. And I said, why not use that to create a test suite, update your variables, do all the dynamic stuff you would expect it to come out of the box. And that&amp;rsquo;s why we created Portman. It started as a PR on that openAPI to Postman package, but then I met Nick from openAPI, from API Deck, sorry. And then we came together and we said, let&amp;rsquo;s collaborate, and let&amp;rsquo;s make a startup package out of it that you can plug in and use it to automate these kind of workflows. And it&amp;rsquo;s really, yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m biased again, but I really like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it sounds awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A question here. May I ask a question here? So have you seen the openAPI generator package that I&amp;rsquo;ve written?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, I saw that and that I had the same comments as I had initially. It generates a nice k6 script, but it it&amp;rsquo;s usually you still have to manually adapt a lot of things and correct it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, but sorry that I interrupted you. There&amp;rsquo;s this latest PR point? I think Michael, if I&amp;rsquo;m currently remembering his name, so Michael added a feature to, to be able to add certain extension to the, to your Swagger or openAPI collection so that it generates everything for you. And if you add examples to your API output, to your responses, then it can extract those examples and put it in your script so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to modify anything. So you can create basically the same thing you did for Postman, you can do it for the openAPI. So the new revision, the new PR and the new version that is released by Ophelia, the maintainer of the openAPI project helps you create a complete test from start to finish with no modification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I think that&amp;rsquo;s great, but we do two types, three types of tests. We will do contract tests, and then we use Newman for it. And we want to use k6 because Newman, it can do schema validation, it can do a lot, I think a lot more than k6 can right now. I think it&amp;rsquo;s also the goal for k6 to do all these contract validation. It can, I guess, but I treat them differently. I think the Newman Postman has more contract testing capabilities, while I think k6 is perfect for performance and load testing at scale, where you only focus on what&amp;rsquo;s the response, is it 200 or is it not a 200, at least that&amp;rsquo;s how I use it actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s fair enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, what Portman does it converts openAPI to Postman. So I&amp;rsquo;m gonna showcase that quickly. So it just took the, this openAPI that&amp;rsquo;s here now, and then gives a while to spin it up. There we go. It&amp;rsquo;s converting it. And if things go well&amp;hellip; Let me check something happening here. Here it is. So here&amp;rsquo;s my Postman collection. It&amp;rsquo;s just generated it. It does everything for you. So it creates, recreate, so there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a collection there. It just recreated for you. And I hope things, it&amp;rsquo;s not showcasing it here. That&amp;rsquo;s bad, too bad. So it just generates and if I would import in Postman, let&amp;rsquo;s quickly do that&amp;hellip; Give me a second to find everything. There we go. So this is the k6 and it&amp;rsquo;s generated by Portman. There we go. If you see you have the same endpoints&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Oh, nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Tim] So the first thing it&amp;rsquo;s great because you don&amp;rsquo;t have to recreate your Postman collection. You just, you just run it from your openAPI specification and you get, as a result, you get your requests pre-tailed already, also your post exercise is ready. So you can see here, it inserts a body, everything, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to do anything. It just takes your openAPI and converts it to Postman. Plus it adds a lot of tests already. You see, it does contract testing by design. So it includes automatically 200 contact applications. So it just injects your contract test in there. And that&amp;rsquo;s really nice because I only need to maintain one document, my openAPI specification, as a result, I get all my requests in Postman, and I get all my tests in Postman without writing any code. I just need to maintain it in the openAPI documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow this is really awesome, Tim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So keep in mind that this was the flow before you had to create your Postman collection and add the tests, and then you could generate k6. Now we turn it around. Now we generate the Postman and request, and then we can use that to generate, okay, six scripts. And so we only need to maintain this part in, yeah, or you know, that&amp;rsquo;s the only thing I need to maintain as a product manager and the team, of course, they built the API and the service and everything, but I get this and I can focus only on this. And this is easy to manage because it&amp;rsquo;s a YAML, you can play around, you can add endpoints, you can remove endpoints and just run it. A minute later, I have a Postman collection to play with it and I can run it at scale with k6, doing the volume tests. What else can I showcase quickly here? Let me see if I can. I just&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Some more nice comments here. Such an awesome flow, says Gertjan, and James says his mind is blown and, and I join him on that sentiment right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Mostafa] Exactly. That&amp;rsquo;s a full test suite, like from start to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and like example, schema validation. It comes out of the box. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to add it. It just does it for you. And the richer you make a documentation, the richer the test suite will become. And it also, Portman, be extended, you can also do variations. So now it just validates if it&amp;rsquo;s a 200, but you can also have it generate 404s, and then it will remove items from it. If it&amp;rsquo;s a required property, it&amp;rsquo;ll create a variation out of it. And then you can test I&amp;rsquo;d the 404s are not present. And so you get two test suites in one go, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow. That is, that&amp;rsquo;s so awesome. Maybe we can like, try and summarize this as we try to collectively recapture our blown minds. So I think that there are two different tools here, Postman and k6, which are really for different things. The Postman is really better for API testing, and as you mentioned, Tim ,contract testing, and k6 is better for load testing. And their features are pretty divergent after a certain point, but they do have a commonality, and it seems like that&amp;rsquo;s what you&amp;rsquo;ve really capitalized on. Mostafa and Tim both have worked on this. and you you&amp;rsquo;re trying to make, you&amp;rsquo;ve gotten us closer to this ideal of having just one set of test suites, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter whether it&amp;rsquo;s automation test suites or load test suites or, it can just be the one thing and you no longer have to maintain two separate ones. And that&amp;rsquo;s having like the amount of time that you need to set it up, but also running it. Because having to explain this to somebody else is also a huge deal when you&amp;rsquo;re not the only tester on your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope, exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the nice thing is as a product manager, I&amp;rsquo;m not technically, so but I can contribute to it. I can, I just need to maintain the openAPI specification and the whole team benefits from anything that I do. If we need to add a new endpoint, I can design it. Not even five minutes later, one minute later, I can just run it in a pipeline, see if it works, and that&amp;rsquo;s a bit, the cycle of spec driven development. You put your spec at the center, the spec at the center, and then you design it, simulate it, fill it, Then you build it, you test it. But the spec is a test driver here and then you can even run it on production and yeah, do the management aspect as well, because then you can monitor it as well based on your API specification. So that&amp;rsquo;s, as a product manager, I&amp;rsquo;m really proud that we pulled this off because that was one of the ambitions when we wanted a newer, or API program, like how can we use a manual workload, what can we automate, and yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m really happy because it&amp;rsquo;s all open source based. There is no other software involved. We just use k6. It has excellent dashboards to individualize reports. We use Postman to generate contract testing and manage it, play around with it. And we benefit from such large ecosystem , Swagger as documentation interface, where you can display or openAPI as well. So it&amp;rsquo;s almost full cycle or I don&amp;rsquo;t know what&amp;rsquo;s the term for it, but yeah, I really, I&amp;rsquo;m really happy with where we are right now. It&amp;rsquo;s a good place to be in an API landscape actually, especially from, yeah&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve taken it a step further, right? This is no longer just about test suites. It&amp;rsquo;s also because you are building on the openAPI specifications, it&amp;rsquo;s all connected even from not just the development part, but the design part. And Pepe actually has a question about this. He says, can you show us more about the process that updates the APIs? What does it do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you mean? This flow, this one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry, which one? Yes, I believe so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The powerful thing about this can also be because if you have an openAPI specification, you can even generate clients or service side code from it so that in the end, your API service can also just be generated from an API specification. There is a really nice openAPI, there&amp;rsquo;s a really nice openAPI open source project, it&amp;rsquo;s called I think openAPI Generator, and then you can just run a C# library or an API for that. You just take your openAPI documentation and you run, you run it and you get as a result, you get C# code that you can run in production. And that&amp;rsquo;s also what we use in our company. You have some teams that just manage to build the openAPI specification and they use that to generate C# code and have APIs up and running in no time. I hope that this is the answering this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, Mostafa, Paul, anything you want to say to Tim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, no questions but, yeah, that would come later, but I need to definitely pass this along, this video along to some people that I used to work with, because this will blow their minds as well. This is something that they definitely need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great job, great job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, great job, exactly. I&amp;rsquo;m literally speechless because I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with all these tools and I know all the&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly not literally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, not the ones that Tim wrote, the ones that we had before. But anyhow, this is a great addition to this mix of open source software that was out there and that we used, and this is basically end-to-end testing. So based on a YAML file, which is an openAPI specification, you can generate tests for your API. You can generate load tests. You can generate, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, like literally everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also documentation. You get documentation, nice looking documentation out the box, a playground with Postman and you get the numbers to back it up with even graphs from k6. I really like your dashboarding. So if you have a customer and they they&amp;rsquo;re asking about SLA, we just pull up some graphs from k6 and everybody&amp;rsquo;s happy with that. So we, the full ecosystem has really matured a lot over the last couple of years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bravo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, this is so freaking awesome. Thank you so much, Tim, for coming on. By the way, he&amp;rsquo;s not even working for k6. He&amp;rsquo;s just, and I think you said at one point, oh, I&amp;rsquo;m a product manager. I&amp;rsquo;m not technical. I beg to differ. This is pretty amazing things that you&amp;rsquo;ve put together. There&amp;rsquo;s a bunch of comments here too. James says he&amp;rsquo;s literally waiting for the livestream to end, so he can link to the video with a timestamp. Well, let&amp;rsquo;s just try and drag it on for him, shall we? Thanh says plus a thousand votes, and people are also saying thank you, and outstanding, almost the holy grail. So lots of fans in comments. Thank you so much, Tim, for joining us. I know we&amp;rsquo;re a bit over time. I&amp;rsquo;m kind of taken aback by how much value you just showed us. This is amazing, I think we need to have you back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna write a blog post for k6 and one for API Deck where I&amp;rsquo;m going to get more into the details because yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s a show now, it&amp;rsquo;s a difficult to but I&amp;rsquo;m gonna try to write it up and then extend a bit on what, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostafa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mostafa, apologies, I&amp;rsquo;m really bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s fine, it&amp;rsquo;s fine, no worries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I think can be really powerful to share with the rest of the world that they can, yeah, maybe use some parts of it or not, but I benefit a lot from it. The whole team benefits a lot from it, actually. I can showcase, this is a pipeline we use, for example. So this is we do tests, then we run Postman and we do tests and if it&amp;rsquo;s 100%, it gets deployed. So it&amp;rsquo;s not just a gimmick, me showcasing it. This is really happening in our company. So we use it to build it. We use it to have nice dashboard with k6 attached to that. So yeah, I&amp;rsquo;m grateful that you put it out there for us to benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s so great, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go on, Mostafa..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Review the article that you want to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, I&amp;rsquo;ll keep Pepe in the loop and then you&amp;rsquo;ll reach out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, thank you. Thank you as well, Paul and Mostafa, for coming on, Mostafa, even though, sorry, I should have invited you even earlier. Thank you everybody for watching. Thanks everyone in the chat. Have a great weekend, everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for having me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, all right, see you all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about my experience in getting started with &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, and how I went from thinking it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t meet my needs at all to not being able to shut up about how awesome it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to use Obsidian, I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it. It didn&amp;rsquo;t seem intuitive to use. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite get it to do what I wanted. And frankly, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t get all of the hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I have over 10,000 notes over multiple vaults in Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what changed? Well, it turns out that there&amp;rsquo;s a pretty crucial element of the experience that I was missing the first time around and that&amp;rsquo;s plugins. Here are my top 10 community plugins for Obsidian so that you don&amp;rsquo;t make the same mistake. \&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian already comes with some core plugins, some of which are enabled by default. Today, I&amp;rsquo;m talking about community plugins, which are extensions to Obsidian that are created by other Obsidian users. The security of your notes is still on you though so think about what you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable with before installing anything. \&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-calendar-and-fantasy-calendar&#34;&gt;Obsidian Calendar and Fantasy Calendar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 10 plugins are arranged alphabetically and the first one is Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calendar is the most popular Obsidian plugin and for a reason. I don&amp;rsquo;t know at this point why you would ever install Obsidian without the Calendar plugin because Obsidian doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a native implementation of a calendar. The Calendar plugin doesn&amp;rsquo;t just show the calendar. It also lets you create daily notes and see those daily notes over the entire month. And it also lets you create weekly reviews if you have that option enabled, which I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Calendar and this other plugin, Fantasy Calendar. Even though Fantasy Calendar definitely was made for use in a tabletop role playing game like Dungeons and Dragons, you don&amp;rsquo;t have use it as that. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Fantasy Calendar as my content calendar in Obsidian. It just provides a little bit more customization than the Calendar plugin can but I install and use both heavily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-dataview&#34;&gt;Obsidian Dataview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number two is Dataview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dataview has changed the way I use Obsidian. It&amp;rsquo;s changed the way I format my notes. It essentially allows you to define parameters and values in the YAML front matter or the metadata of your notes and then it lets you search for them. So it essentially lets you create your own database in Obsidian with custom fields for anything that you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could use it for meetings or people or tools or books that you&amp;rsquo;ve read. The possibilities are endless. By the way, in addition to the very SQL-like query language that they have, you can also use JavaScript in Dataview. There&amp;rsquo;s just so much to do with this plugin. And I really haven&amp;rsquo;t even scratched the surface of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-editor-syntax-highlight&#34;&gt;Obsidian Editor Syntax Highlight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number three is so small but so useful that I had to include it in the list. It is Editor Syntax Highlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever copied over any code into Obsidian, you may find that it lacks a little bit in readability. Editors Syntax Highlight dramatically improves readability by changing the syntax highlighting depending on the programming language that you select. It isn&amp;rsquo;t going to replace VS Code anytime soon, but if you&amp;rsquo;re like me and you use it sort of as a dev log while you&amp;rsquo;re trying figure something out and you include your final solution or the code into your note, then I think that this is a must-have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-kanban&#34;&gt;Obsidian Kanban&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number four is Kanban which is funny because I don&amp;rsquo;t even usually like the Kanban approach. I never understood Trello and I never liked Post-it Notes. I don&amp;rsquo;t use Kanban for task management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered what it&amp;rsquo;s really good for is a content calendar. I create a card in Kanban for every bit of content that I&amp;rsquo;d like to work on, whether that&amp;rsquo;s code or a section in a workshop, a blog post, a video, or really basically anything. I really like being able to create my own columns and spicing it up by embedding photos within the card itself. It just makes the whole process a lot more visual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-outliner&#34;&gt;Obsidian Outliner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number five is Outliner. Before Obsidian, I was using Roam and it definitely shows. While I&amp;rsquo;ve moved on philosophically from Roam Research, I still love the very task-oriented bulletin format that it had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Outliner brings the same thing to Obsidian. So you can have your keyboard shortcuts for quickly moving something up and down a list or indenting and unindenting as well. It has made my transition from Roam Research significantly easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-periodic-notes&#34;&gt;Obsidian Periodic Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number six is Periodic Notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think one of the most fundamental philosophical differences between Obsidian and tools like Evernote is that Obsidian doesn&amp;rsquo;t want you to just capture it all. Obsidian is about bringing those notes to the forefront, processing them, analyzing them, really learning them, and then changing them as your knowledge changes and Periodic Notes really helps with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is particularly useful for OKR or objective setting because it provides a system for reviewing notes daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to use all of those, but I find that using some of them is really useful in helping me step back and think about what I actually want to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-publish&#34;&gt;Obsidian Publish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number seven probably would be my number one if I were ranking these, but since it&amp;rsquo;s alphabetical, number seven is Obsidian Publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian Publish is a premium add-on to Obsidian that lets you instantly publish all of your notes or at least the notes that you select to be published to a certain domain. Now I have it going to a custom domain and yes, it&amp;rsquo;s not free. And yes, I do know that there are other ways that you could do this with markdown files. I have my personal blog using Hugo as a static generator for instance, but there&amp;rsquo;s just something about Publish and just it taking just a few clicks between writing something and putting it out there that really reduces the inertia for me to learn in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning in public and growing a digital garden that is constantly changing is really important to me and it has been essential to my professional and personal development. So Obsidian Publish has to be, hands-down, my favorite plugin for Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-readwise-official&#34;&gt;Obsidian Readwise Official&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number eight is the Readwise Official plugin and this is a plugin that I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting for a very long time. In fact, before the official plugin came out, I created my own Python script that I was running regularly just to be able to move my things from Readwise to Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt;, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know, is a way to collect all of the things that you&amp;rsquo;re doing on the internet. It&amp;rsquo;s an easy way to collect eBooks, web articles, audiobooks, tweets, and even PDFs. And it all brings your highlights of those into your Obsidian vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a really essential part to my learning process because it ensures that everything I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from a variety of different sources ends up in my Obsidian vault for me to process and analyze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-sync&#34;&gt;Obsidian Sync&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number nine is Obsidian Sync and it is also a premium add-on, kind of like Obsidian Publish, but it&amp;rsquo;s also totally optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t really need Obsidian Sync. I already use Dropbox, but unfortunately, one of the problems with Dropbox is that you can&amp;rsquo;t yet use it to sync between different devices. I use Obsidian on my laptop, on my iPad, and on my Samsung mobile. So I have three different devices that I need all of my notes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently two options for this. It&amp;rsquo;s either iCloud or Obsidian Sync. I don&amp;rsquo;t like iCloud, and so, Obsidian Sync is my service of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-templater&#34;&gt;Obsidian Templater&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number 10 is the most recent plugin of this 10 and it is Templater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now don&amp;rsquo;t get it confused with Templates which is an Obsidian core plugin. TemplateR is a community plugin that&amp;rsquo;s like Templates on steroids. It extends templating functionality by letting you run JavaScript in your vault. This blows the functionality of Obsidian wide open as now I can run JavaScript in my vault to do certain things for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already a fan of the core plugin Templates, so having Templater and all of the customization options that are possible is just amazing. Definitely recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve made it this far and you&amp;rsquo;re wondering what the heck is Obsidian, well maybe take a step back and watch this video on how to get started with Obsidian. And if you want to know about my usage of any of the particular plugins that I mentioned, leave me a comment below so that I know that I should make a video on that next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for watching. Happy note taking!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On this week&amp;rsquo;s Office Hours, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/javaducky&#34;&gt;Paul Balogh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/srperf&#34;&gt;Leandro Melendez&lt;/a&gt; join me to talk about how to design workload models in k6 load testing scripts using scenarios and executors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3AJLSH0Ifm4&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, and welcome to another k6 office hours. I am Nicole van der Hoeven, and for the first time, all three of us developer advocates are in one stream. Could you please introduce yourselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, who&amp;rsquo;s going first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right, age before beauty, as they say. Okay, well, hey, I&amp;rsquo;m Paul Balogh, the newest DevRel here at k6, nice to meet you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on my end Leandro Melendez, also known as a Senor Performo, very happy to contribute here and bringing, usually it&amp;rsquo;s knowledge, but this time I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be a little bit on the learning side, which is super exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I mean, I don&amp;rsquo;t think you can really have one without the other. I think it&amp;rsquo;s super valuable to also just ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Nicole, I&amp;rsquo;m a little disappointed that you don&amp;rsquo;t have a fake mustache to support Leandro and I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. That is not something that I just have lying around, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may have to fix that. I was commenting the equivalent here in Mexico is the unibrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could potentially draw something on my face, maybe, I could try that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that the Frida Kahlo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Leandro and Paul are relatively new to k6. I think you both have been here for less than a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a month here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, just a month now, that&amp;rsquo;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is the first time, I&amp;rsquo;ve been here with you with each of you separately, but this is the first time that all three of us are here. It is pretty cool, welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exciting, hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s not overload for everybody watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. One thing that I wanted to get out of the way is that we have a very awesome community, we have several community champions, but one of them, NaveenKumar, just posted a couple of videos on how to use checks and thresholds in k6. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to put that in the comments, as well, because I thought that they were pretty awesome videos. NaveenKumar has a YouTube channel where he goes through a bunch of different tools, including k6, but also like JMeter and Gatling, and he always does a good job, so check those out. Oops, I actually didn&amp;rsquo;t post his videos, I think I posted the documentation for what we were talking about, so that&amp;rsquo;s a little premature. Sorry about that, let me put the actual links this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is a live podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, obviously. Sorry, you get what you get. So if that hadn&amp;rsquo;t already tipped you off, what we actually want to about today are scenarios and executors in k6. You may have been confused by the thumbnail because it was like, I realized afterwards, that it was the three of us, our photos, and then the words executors in k6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here come the executors, the three of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that&amp;rsquo;s our new name or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, if you invert the k6 logo, it almost looks like a guillotine, so maybe we are the executors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had not noticed that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a little morbid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, you know, hey, I do what I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re going like play Beatles songs backwards and all that type of stuff, man. I&amp;rsquo;m sure it was not on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like we&amp;rsquo;ve lost access to LinkedIn for some reason, but, oh well, this has happened before. Thank you, Mark, for saying we&amp;rsquo;re killer performance engineers, love the pun. So the reason that I wanted to talk about this was that, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if you also have got the same, Leandro, Leandro and I were both in the Automation Guild 2022. We both had a talk there and there are a lot of common questions that come up with regards to load testing. And a lot of it has to do with the results, specifically when, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if you can actually hear the wind in my background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that you, oh wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m okay, but apparently there&amp;rsquo;s a storm that&amp;rsquo;s in Northern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was gonna say, hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll still be in Kansas, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know. It&amp;rsquo;s like 140 kilometer per hour winds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t end up in Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But can I be the straw man, at least, in this Oz thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always liked him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;rsquo;m Dorothy. Or the wizard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask Toto, please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got Toto around here somewhere, let her in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one question that I was getting a lot, or I saw other people talking about variations of it, was the situation where you might have already run your load test and seen all check marks and everything passed, and the response times were within the expected results, and yet when the application goes live, suddenly there&amp;rsquo;s all these errors, and performance issues, and maybe production incidents that you never saw in any of your tests. And the question is, how can that be when you&amp;rsquo;ve done your testing and you didn&amp;rsquo;t find any of that and you only see it in production?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, of course I experienced that several times, but many things come to mind on, in what environment did you test? What happened in this environment? If you test in production, hopefully &amp;lsquo;cause we are modern performance engineers that are not afraid of testing in production. Settings, changes, what was the workload? I mean, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, the list is pretty long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot that, that could, that&amp;rsquo;s why that question is hard to answer because there&amp;rsquo;s no one answer. It&amp;rsquo;s like, oh and that happens, always check this. And that&amp;rsquo;s also because it could be that there&amp;rsquo;s something different with the environment. Like maybe it&amp;rsquo;s you didn&amp;rsquo;t test the same version of the code even, or maybe you were testing in not a production-like environment in terms of size, or test data, or something like that. But another reason that I think is easier because we testers normally control it is on the side of the script. It could be that you weren&amp;rsquo;t testing the things that you actually wanted to test. And a big part of that, I think, is workload modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s one that I also wanted to comment, &amp;lsquo;cause that has been a pain in different occasions. On one hand, watch model, &amp;lsquo;cause from what you&amp;rsquo;re saying, there were these projects where in the end we were told, hey, this is a workload, this is a utilization that we are expecting to have in production or that we actually have in production, we want you to test for this. And it was nothing like that. We were told, yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s a thousand clicks per day, but you wanna test an emergency center when there&amp;rsquo;s a tornado. How is that true, how is that relevant, or vice versa? For some reason, our scripts are just simulating a thousand clicks per day where it&amp;rsquo;s 10,000 billions, gazillions, what would&amp;rsquo;ve been the right thing. Of course your performance test is gonna be awesome if you underdid it. And the other side of the risk, everyone running and, like, the system is dying, what is happening? Oh, we&amp;rsquo;re pressing it too hard, sorry, our bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s true, could go both ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But definitely you always have to worry about configuration drift anyway. Differences in your environments, unless you&amp;rsquo;re using something like a terraform or something, infrastructure is code where you can make sure that your environments are equal. So if you do your load testing and performance testing in a lower environment or isolated environment that it gets some of that, that it is truly configured the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, even when the environments are exactly identical, though, let&amp;rsquo;s just say that it&amp;rsquo;s possible to say that, yeah, there are still situations where if your load tests weren&amp;rsquo;t simulating realistic enough load, then you can&amp;rsquo;t really, you may not be able to apply those results to production either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one thing, as I said earlier, on one hand, the problem to getting those realistic numbers, at times, the team doesn&amp;rsquo;t even know, they have no idea what are you asking for. All they know is we want to be able to handle 10 users in the system. I&amp;rsquo;m kind of simplifying it, usually it&amp;rsquo;s 10 billion users or something like that, right. Okay, 10 billion users, what does that translate into in terms of utilization? And they go like utiliti-what? And that&amp;rsquo;s the first struggle, right. Supposing that you get the right numbers that you know exactly how much to stress each thing, &amp;lsquo;cause there there&amp;rsquo;s another differentiator, right. We get this action a thousand times, okay, but to get to that action at times or on some systems that are the same, you have to do others many more times, less times, and they are just telling you about this one. What is the proportion, how much to stress the other one that the other one does need not that many times? So that&amp;rsquo;s one discussion. If you get the numbers right then to landing it into the script and your scenarios, also, it&amp;rsquo;s a very interesting situation, headache-bringing situation at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think part of the problem is that a lot of times, when we think about load testing, there are only a few parameters that we think about immediately. One them is the number of virtual users. Another one is the test duration. And sometimes you might get like a request per second, like you were saying, Leandro, but those three don&amp;rsquo;t really describe the shape of a load. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of like trying to encapsulate test results into an average figure, like when you get the geometric mean of something, it&amp;rsquo;s not a great way to express the distribution. You know, if you say that the average response time is three seconds, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that you don&amp;rsquo;t have really high response times. Like you could still have a handful of requests that are at 15 seconds, but maybe the rest of them are a hundred milliseconds. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t really&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurately describe the whole context, the big picture of the load. And in the same way, things like the number of virtual users, and duration, and requests per second also don&amp;rsquo;t show the entire picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, wen you&amp;rsquo;re describing it that way, it makes me think when you are asked to describe someone, oh, has beautiful glasses. I mean, I was talking about Paul, sorry, Nicole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, no, I like your glasses, too. But you need a full picture, right? There are so many elements that a scenario or a workload model includes, so many variations, details that, yeah, as you were saying, I need 10 million users in the system doing what, how often, how long, how many of them are doing which ones? And many of those things, you have to get into the weeds to truly understand and design &amp;lsquo;cause this is another one, you will want different workloads for different type of load scenarios. You should not, I was gonna say you cannot, but you can try, but it&amp;rsquo;s not recommended at all to try to kill too many birds with a single stone. You may be able to get two, but more than that gets complicated, gets crazy. So you have to create a work model for that specific risk situation, that scenario that you want to test for. Just one at a time gets challenging, getting all those components, all those items and things that you need to be careful putting together to model and simulate something that resembles realistically that risk scenario, that risk circumstance that you want to test for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here you go again with that killer mentality there, killing multiple birds with one stone. And now Mark&amp;rsquo;s making comments here that actually for killers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, okay, let&amp;rsquo;s say you may be looking for a needle into multiple haystacks, no killing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about what you were saying about the hypothetical scenario of a thousand requests over 24 hours. There&amp;rsquo;s still so many ways to interpret that, right? Because it could be, one interpretation could be, take a thousand requests divided by 24 hours and that&amp;rsquo;s the amount of load that you want to test with a one-hour load test. It could be like that, but if it&amp;rsquo;s emergency services, there are certain times of the day when emergencies are more likely. It could be seasonal, as well, like the incidents of emergencies of ambulances that are sent out increases over the holidays for inexplicable reasons. That kind of thing does give more context than just a thousand over 24 hours. I mean, if you just look at a period of 24 hours, those thousand could have been simulated, could have happened in one hour for all you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step in a little far from the ambulance example, don&amp;rsquo;t wanna go more on the killer topic. Let&amp;rsquo;s think of a restaurant, if they say, this Golden Arches restaurant, we sell a thousand burgers per day. Okay. Most probably you are selling 80% of that at lunchtime and the rest of the hours we don&amp;rsquo;t care about. So those different behaviors during that period of time is what we should focus on, or care for, or have better information. Well, in the morning you get more, what&amp;rsquo;s the name of the thing, hash Browns, no burgers. Even if you are the same restaurant, which one do you want to simulate? What is the utilization at different periods in time during the day? &amp;lsquo;Cause yeah, probably no one, not that many people get a milkshake in the morning, but most of them getting in the night. So some of those variations, you want to make sure that you are doing the right mix, not only how many at a single number per long period of time, what happens each hour of the day, which ones do you care for. As a restaurant, I would say I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna simulate a load test of, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, after lunchtime where everyone is gone and we are super quiet. I don&amp;rsquo;t care load test-wise, right. But lunch time, breakfast time, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, 7:00 AM in a gym, I want to test those type of things of what people are doing and focus on, get a good work load model for what is happening at those times, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I thought, Mark has a couple comments here. I think also the number of vusers or threads compared to the target arrival rate or expected response time for me is the health of the workload generation. And he follows up with, also synchronizing or rendezvous vuser requests is underused in my opinion. Do you agree, Leandro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s in my personal experience, there have been a few times, at least on the render view or synchronizing part, there are not that many times where I had to leverage those functionalities. I think it kind of depends on the projects that you work on. One that comes to mind, and I really love this example for workload modeling in general, is I worked at a gaming company, Australia&amp;rsquo;s largest gaming company, and the project that I worked on was for the Melbourne Cup. So they sold tickets for the Melbourne Cup. And if you don&amp;rsquo;t know, and probably you don&amp;rsquo;t unless you&amp;rsquo;re Australian, but the Melbourne Cup is a horse race. It is like a two-minute horse race that is for some reason incredibly popular in Australia, in my state, in Victoria, &amp;lsquo;cause I lived in Melbourne, we actually got a public holiday for it. So, it&amp;rsquo;s that big. And for some companies, for a lot of these betting companies, the revenue from that one race could be up to 80% of the entire year&amp;rsquo;s revenue. So it is that big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in that two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and that&amp;rsquo;s the thing. Betting is open until the race starts. And yet when you look at the workload model for that, it really, the load spikes, the betting spikes just in the few seconds before the race. And that&amp;rsquo;s for a number of reasons, people might not have had the chance to bet earlier in the week because they were working or something. And if you have a public holiday, then you do have the time to just be there watching. And also there are, depending on the types of bet that you placed, there could be a difference in odds. So they&amp;rsquo;re trying to get the last possible information that they can before they have to make a decision about which horse to back. And that&amp;rsquo;s a good case for a rendezvous because there is a clear cutoff and sometimes you see the reverse, like for example, in a university portal or one of these shopping sales, where at midnight all the sales go live. And so you get people maybe refreshing that page all up to that point and then, bam, all of a sudden they start checking out things. And that would be, I think, a good time to use rendezvous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, and in a quick example, you got me thinking, as well, video gaming, when you are on these multiplayer games, most probably everyone watching this are familiar, campaigns, online campaigns, certainly there are so many things happening, there are people playing other things, but a campaign is gonna start at this moment, this schedule. I think there a rendezvous would be a very good use of those type of things. Sadly, in my experience, some of those situations were solved with a spike scenario run out here with an average day in production, so overlapping scenarios. But that&amp;rsquo;s interesting &amp;lsquo;cause, as well, it depends on how do you want to tackle that problem. We are going to have a normal day and suddenly something&amp;rsquo;s gonna happen. How do we simulate it? How do we model that workload? What tools do we use? That&amp;rsquo;s a very good point, and again, with performance testing and load testing, there&amp;rsquo;s no one size fit all or the way to do everything. No, it depends, and you can get two very similar loads, simulations, workloads with different approaches, with different things. And that&amp;rsquo;s one that I also wanted to mention, like when modeling, it&amp;rsquo;s something that when you wanna try to get, there are two elements that I like a lot and I struggle a lot of times, when you are modeling your workloads, you have to somewhat randomize the actions. A big thing that we used to leverage in the load runner days was randomized think time in between steps. But eventually you have to say, okay, it&amp;rsquo;s randomized, it&amp;rsquo;s happening, like real people is using the system, but in the end I want just this process, just this virtual user to iterate a thousand times in an hour. Oh, but I have random times in between, okay let&amp;rsquo;s, that modeling, as well, I can tell got so interesting. And even like mathematic, not too complex, but mathematic functions like, okay, over time we have this deviation, if everything goes in the higher random wait time, we may get up here, we may get down there, so on average we&amp;rsquo;ll be simulating this. It&amp;rsquo;s all so challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, those delays are definitely part of the workload model. In k6, we call them sleep. In JMeter, they&amp;rsquo;re timers. LoadRunner is think time. There are a lot of different terms for it, but basically a delay is some sort of planned sleep in your script that is meant to simulate a real user maybe taking time to think about what they&amp;rsquo;re going to do next, or read the text on the screen, or type out something in a form. And it actually can have a pretty significant impact on your load tests. First of all, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have any think time at all, then you need to be careful that you&amp;rsquo;re not maxing out your CPU and memory utilization on your load generator because that situation where you&amp;rsquo;re just very quickly firing off requests may not be entirely realistic. And I think that if you have think time that&amp;rsquo;s always the same time, like this is what you were talking about, having dynamic ones, if you always use the same value for your think time, you might see the staggering in your results, but that&amp;rsquo;s due to how your test is set up and not at all to do with how your application is responding. And then if you use dynamic think time, like you said, it can make it harder to plan because it&amp;rsquo;s more difficult to know exactly how many iterations your test is going to complete. So there&amp;rsquo;s always trade-offs, right. There&amp;rsquo;s no one way that&amp;rsquo;s always the best way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it depends, as well, on what are you actually trying to simulate. As you mentioned, there are times where we put think times that want to simulate a real person using the system. There are some others where you just don&amp;rsquo;t want these events to happen at the same time. To give you an example would be like if your script was a soldier marching one, two, one, two, and you&amp;rsquo;re adding soldiers at the same pace, one, two, eventually they all will be doing the same step at the very same time. If you are simulating a military parade or something like that, that&amp;rsquo;s awesome. You have the test. On that time, you may want that to happen or, or work it out with some rendezvous continuously happening. But if not, if you just want to simulate a regular march or people passing in the subway, they are not like one, two, one, it would be very interesting to see, but that&amp;rsquo;s not how real people walk in the every day. There are situations for everything, and it&amp;rsquo;s challenging at times, as you say, not only wait in between steps, but waiting after you complete a cycle and you want to start another one. There, you may also want some randomization or not to be that static so that your generally load simulations do not have to be that robotic, even if they are done by robots or virtual users. So there are several trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an extension to your metaphor, I think you&amp;rsquo;ll like, Leandro, what if instead, this is a way that your script might change depending on the business processes and the context of the industry. So what if instead of trying to simulate a military, what you&amp;rsquo;re actually trying to do is simulate Fremen running across the open sand, trying to not have patterns in their steps to avoid attracting Shai-Hulud, the great worm. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know the reference, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. But in that case you do not want anything constant. You want something more dynamic, something that isn&amp;rsquo;t easily noticeable, that won&amp;rsquo;t skew the results as much. Oh, we have a question from ChipsAho. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s just the Filipino thing, but there&amp;rsquo;s actually a good packet of cookies that&amp;rsquo;s called Chips Ahoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahoy, love them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are faced with budget constraints, how would you prioritize the workload model to use? That&amp;rsquo;s really good. And they follow up with, as performance engineers, I know sometimes our curiosity tends to get the best of us, trying to see how the system behaves in different circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, answering to, oh yeah, ChipsAho, is from Ahoy, very good cookies, put &amp;rsquo;em in the microwave eight seconds and you&amp;rsquo;ll love &amp;rsquo;em. So it depends a lot, I would say, and your budget constraints, what are you testing would be my question. What risks does your application will face, or what are the most common reasons? Again, there&amp;rsquo;s no silver bullet or single test that will clear all your performance risks ever again that you may have under loads. What loads were you? What things may harm your system? Those are the ones that you need to focus and prioritize based on that risk. If you already tested one, you know that it&amp;rsquo;ll survive, next test, maybe go to the next one and down the ladder, the risk ladder. But first it depends on your system. What is it going to subject to? What are the processes? And the risks may be different a spring ago from today. You may be releasing a new process that is super critical, super dangerous, will be touching databases or doing important or even dangerous queries. This time, you may want to focus on that one. There&amp;rsquo;s no one test to rule them all, one workload scenario, so it depends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there are a few things that I would think about first. What is, like Leandro said, what&amp;rsquo;s the biggest risk? Meaning if there&amp;rsquo;s something where if you don&amp;rsquo;t load test this component there might be security implications, test that. Anything that&amp;rsquo;s critical, like payment or something that might affect compliance regulations for whatever industry it is, meaning like how you handle individuals&amp;rsquo; data, potentially identifiable data, that would be worth load testing. And also anything that&amp;rsquo;s very public, so maybe something like you&amp;rsquo;re about us page is nowhere near as public as your homepage. It can deal your company very significant damage, but hard to quantify damage, in terms of reputation, if your entire homepage is down, rather than if your about us page is down. So that could be a situation where something is not really mission critical or important to the business functionality, but it still would deal a lot of damage. So that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of reputation risk, I guess. A question here not about executors, but we can quickly talk about that. Do we get any performance HTML report in browser k6 load testing? Not yet &amp;lsquo;cause this person specified browser. So I don&amp;rsquo;t think that we have that yet for browser, but there are a few extensions. There&amp;rsquo;s the xk6 dashboard one by Ivan Skiba. And there&amp;rsquo;s also xk6, what is it called, xk6 HTML report or something like that. Go have a look at the session that I just had, the show that I just had with Paul last week, actually, where we talked about this very thing. They&amp;rsquo;re both extensions and they&amp;rsquo;re both awesome. They give like a, the Ivan Skiba one, I think, is the one that you did, Paul, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and actually I was gonna show that a little bit later here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, all right, well let me know when you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might as well jump into that, &amp;lsquo;cause I definitely want to show some things about how to actually implement these workload models in k6. So one way that you can do that is by using scenarios. So I have, let&amp;rsquo;s just start with this one. So I have one script here, it is a protocol level script. And I&amp;rsquo;m just putting it in a separate JavaScript file just so this is a little cleaner to look at, so that we can focus on the scenario. In k6, we have something called scenarios that are ways to set things that run independently of each other. So you can have it be consecutive, or run one before the other, or you can have them run simultaneously. So this one just has, this example that I&amp;rsquo;ve got up now is just one scenario and it has an executor. So let&amp;rsquo;s talk a little bit about executors because this is something that&amp;rsquo;s specific to k6. So let&amp;rsquo;s look here. An executor is basically a way to change the way that the load looks. There are a bunch in k6 and I&amp;rsquo;m actually going to, I already, &amp;lsquo;cause I get this question a lot, I&amp;rsquo;m going to put this in the chat because I have this cheat sheet for how to go about thinking, deciding which one to use. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to post it in the chat and we, I think that the rule of thumb is if you want to just try one, you can, or you want a simple one, it&amp;rsquo;s probably ramping-vus that you want. And that&amp;rsquo;s because this is the default one and a lot of load testing tools where you set the number of virtual users and duration and then sometimes you might have stages. This is also what k6 defaults to. So let&amp;rsquo;s have a look. This is what that looks like. As you can see, I have ramping-vus set here, and this is a way to change the load depending on the number of virtual users. I also have these stages here. The first one is kind of like, I was trying to simulate a ramp up. So from when the test starts, this will start with zero virtual users. I&amp;rsquo;ve got that set here. And then it&amp;rsquo;ll gradually ramp up to 10 over five minutes. This is shorter because I think I was trying to, this was from a demo, so I was trying to make it something that we&amp;rsquo;d actually get results from, but this could be, you know, 30 minutes, if you wanted, depending on your test. And then this is kind of what we call steady state, where the number of virtual users doesn&amp;rsquo;t fluctuate. It&amp;rsquo;s just holding steady for this period of time, in this case 10 minutes. And this last one where it goes from 10 virtual users to zero is reflective of a ramp down. Paul, did you want to share your screen &amp;lsquo;cause I know you said you had some things in cloud to show us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did, yes. And then unfortunately I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to share for my script, there&amp;rsquo;s something going on with my system here. But let me go ahead and share my browser, which is working. So yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is a script that I had done and what I did was, as I was trying to go through and then figure out all these different executors, I wanted to see the pattern that each of these executors applies. So now here, let me, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s better if I start down here. So this is the actual script that I executed. So if you look here, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that in these scenarios and hopefully, let me see if I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Yeah, I was just going to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Paul] A little bit more legible, there we go. I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one that may have old eyes and just can&amp;rsquo;t see. So I loaded up the options so that I would have all these different scenarios. &amp;lsquo;Cause I wanted to see every one of these executors and I wanted to be able to see what kind of pattern that they applied. And originally you&amp;rsquo;ll see that some of these numbers are a little bit different, but these are all the very specific things that each one requires. So in this case, the shared iteration scenario, and again, I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna be the expert on what each of these different executors provides, but they&amp;rsquo;re in the docs. So yeah, we can go through there. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be working on these docs, as well, in the next couple weeks and try to clean these up a little bit more, maybe make &amp;rsquo;em a little bit more, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, state it a little bit differently or to help my understanding anyway. But yeah, so I loaded this up, so I have each one of the different executors set up. So here&amp;rsquo;s the ramping, so similar to what Nicole was talking about with the different durations. So here over a ten-second period, I had it ramp up to, I think, from zero to 10 vus. And then for 10 seconds I would have it keep going at a level 10, so it would be a flat top. And then the last 10 seconds would be ramping down to zero. All these other ones here, too. So, I put every one of these in there so that way then we could go ahead and compare them and, whoa, let me, all right. So each one of these is kind of denoted here and I guess I can&amp;rsquo;t, I wish I could isolate these and then what&amp;rsquo;s really, I guess, the most important here is the purple line and hopefully you&amp;rsquo;re not, no one&amp;rsquo;s really color blind or missing the color differences here. But yeah, so the purple line is the actual number of the request coming through. And then this blue line, or the aqua, is the actual response time for the service. We&amp;rsquo;ll just kind of focus on the purple line that&amp;rsquo;s what these executors are really affecting more so. And then the gray line, this shaded area is actually the virtual users. So you&amp;rsquo;ll see that here it started at zero, and then it ramped up for a period of time, and then it started kind of flattening, and then it would ramp down. Now this is for the accumulation of all the different executors. Unfortunately, and this might be something I might put in as an issue to possibly add or an enhancement is that each one of these lines here is a scenario. So this actually has the shape from that particular executor. So it&amp;rsquo;d be nice to show the vus in here, as well, but you can kind of infer it based on the activity, the request. So again, that&amp;rsquo;s the purple line again. And so here, you see this executor actually ran pretty quickly to get to the number of requests. I was trying to keep them about the same because I wanted to do, like, a progress bar race. So when I was running this locally, I could see the different areas in which was actually completing the same number of requests faster and all that. But yeah, so this was kind of my playing around and, again, this is on the cloud product. So this is an add feature. But now with talking about the HTML reporting, this is what I actually did here. So let me go ahead and I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go ahead and run this script again. Now unfortunately, you&amp;rsquo;re not gonna be able to see the actual execution as I run it locally, but let&amp;rsquo;s see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Paul, we got a question about the k6 cloud results that you were showing. Could you create a shareable link so that people can also have a look at it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Paul] Well, let&amp;rsquo;s see. How can I do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] You can go to the three dots in the upper right. Yep, and then share test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Paul] All right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] We can just copy and paste that into the chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Paul] Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Leandro] And then they are out into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Paul] Out into the world, yeah. Awesome, cool. See, today I learned again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Yeah. Awesome. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad you did this, though, because I wanted to, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to doing it. So I&amp;rsquo;m really glad you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Paul] Yeah, and then I wanted to actually have them separate so I could kind of show each one&amp;rsquo;s pattern again. That&amp;rsquo;s the thing that I was really trying to get to, and I&amp;rsquo;ll probably put together a blog post, so keep an eye out for that, where I&amp;rsquo;ll kind of go through that, and describe, and show patterns that are created by the executors. And then that is as I learn more. Again, so this is, this dashboard that I&amp;rsquo;m showing here, this is actually an extension. So I did compile this into the k6 binary, custom with this output. And this is available here. This is this xk6 dashboard, and this is also included in our registry on the site, so you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to find this as well. Pretty easy to do this, the xk6, to create the extension and build it. But anyway, we can always give help. Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go ahead in this other window, and I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go ahead and start this test running. So now as we see here, and I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to refresh, but let&amp;rsquo;s see, go ahead and refresh here. All right. So now this test is running in the background. And then we should start seeing the output. There we go. Now, there is a delay. So behind the scenes, this is actually using, it&amp;rsquo;s creating Prometheus-based metrics and then it&amp;rsquo;s serving that up in a little web server locally. So it&amp;rsquo;s really cool. So I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to play around with it nearly as much as I need to, but anyway, but this is something, it&amp;rsquo;s a nice little tool to be able to use if you don&amp;rsquo;t want just the plain text display in your console. But yeah, so this test is actually already completed. Now, it&amp;rsquo;s actually still running in a way, though, because we have this externally controlled executor where now from another terminal I could sit there and I could say, okay, yeah, now I wanna ramp up the vus to 10 or that type of a thing, just via rest API. But unfortunately, due to technical difficulties, I can&amp;rsquo;t show you that, but I will definitely put that in the blog post when I start putting that together. Anyway, this is one of those cool little tools with this extension that you can kind of, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, really get some cool results. But yeah, that was the big thing. Here&amp;rsquo;s for the external access, this is the rest API where I could sit there and call that custom executor and say pause testing or even to ramp up the number of vus. Still figuring this out a little bit. It&amp;rsquo;s a little, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, it needs some play around with it a little bit to get a good understanding of it. But yeah, I wanted to show that, again, you can do this stuff, have the graphics there. Now, the HTML report that Nicole was talking about, that&amp;rsquo;s something where, yeah, you could save that off, and again, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the graphics, I don&amp;rsquo;t think, if I remember correctly, but it does have it where you could then save that off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not real time either. But it is more like a report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, yeah. That&amp;rsquo;s it, let me go ahead and stop that test. Oh yeah. So again, I will put together something so that way then if anybody wants these details and obviously you can use that link, so it&amp;rsquo;s now shareable, so I will make sure to not delete it .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great. I do want to share something, Paul, if you&amp;rsquo;re okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great. So I also wanted to talk about the fact that we can do it, you can put together a scenario using different executors, but another thing that you could do is have each scenario be a completely different test. One could be a load test. Another could be a chaos engineering test, for instance. Like this is one that I had where this get Pokemon is an HTTP request that just hits the API. And this is intended to be more of a load test, but then you could have a chaos scenario and you can say that at a certain point, you fire off this thing that then terminates one of the pods in Kubernetes, according to certain conditions. This is using the xk6-chaos extension. But in this way, you can see that these are not just load-testing scenarios. These are just testing scenarios and they&amp;rsquo;re different types of testing that you could use. Another type other than chaos is browser testing now that we&amp;rsquo;ve got xk6 browser. So now you can do things where you have one scenario that&amp;rsquo;s doing some sort of protocol level test and the other one is doing a browser level test. And because those two are fundamentally different, you may want to be able to control them separately. You probably won&amp;rsquo;t be wanting to generate majority of the load with a browser level test, for instance, you probably wanna do that with your protocol level test, but you might want to piggyback off of the protocol test and run a few, like a handful, of browser users just to be able to get some front-end metrics. So, I think it&amp;rsquo;s kind of cool that you can do that. Another thing that you can do with scenarios and executors, well, it&amp;rsquo;s something with workload modeling anyway for k6, this is a script that I&amp;rsquo;ve got for percentages. Now, I think the use case for this, I mean, there are a lot of use cases, but what I actually think this could be used for is an e-commerce scenario where a typical scenario is to have like 100% of the virtual users go into your homepage, and then maybe 50% of them go and browse through the product pages, and then of that 50%, maybe only half of those actually added to the cart. So that is also something that isn&amp;rsquo;t directly related to scenarios and executors, but it does have something to do with the workload model of your test. So in this example, I&amp;rsquo;m setting a random number between one and 100, and then depending on that, I have this combination, in this case, I&amp;rsquo;m setting different clients for it. So let&amp;rsquo;s say that there&amp;rsquo;s a really big client that we want to use 50% of the time, you could use that, and then pass that on to some request that you&amp;rsquo;re sending. And in this way, you&amp;rsquo;re already making something that&amp;rsquo;s more realistic than just get a client, just get details for a client. Well, which client is that because maybe that&amp;rsquo;s being cached? Maybe you do want it to be cached, you&amp;rsquo;d have to see what you want, what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to achieve with that particular test, but it all has an impact on your testing results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and if I may add for learning some of these functionalities, it makes, and I think I started a comment how the situations, how the ramp-ups work, how when we want to model these targets in the old days, as I said, getting these, okay, my user takes this amount of time of execution, it has this amount of random timers, and it&amp;rsquo;s a pain at times when your process starts to degrade a little bit of performance, and because of that, they don&amp;rsquo;t go as fast as you need them to, as you want to generate, because you did the calculations based on optimal response times, right. So some of these controls will be very useful depending on the scenario that you are wanting to focus and not to do all that type of crazy math that we had to do. I remember with the load runner days, it was like, okay, but if the response time starts to deviate a little bit, this we need to, there&amp;rsquo;s so much that on this situation with some of these options, k6 can mutate may be the wrong word, but adapt to what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to do, right, and keep doing the loads and doing those processes that you are aimed for. There are some others that you are like, if the system starts to go slow, the users will slow down and that&amp;rsquo;s right, that&amp;rsquo;s okay, that&amp;rsquo;s normal, but on others it&amp;rsquo;s like, no, I absolutely want that the users keep coming, keeps hearing the system, even if the system is slowing or many other things that can start to happen. These controls truly make our lives easier. in so many of those situations like crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a question from SJ who says, is there a pacing config in k6 or maybe a throughput controller equivalent? So let&amp;rsquo;s talk about pacing, Pacing and load testing terms is related to think time in that it does impose some sort of timing on the requests, but while a think time is more like a direct sleep on a thread, pacing is more like the space between each iteration and there are different ways to achieve this. k6 doesn&amp;rsquo;t have something that is exactly pacing. But for instance, the way that JMeter would do this is by using the throughput controller, which is what I think SJ is alluding to. And so instead of specifying the time between each iteration, JMeter does it by allowing you to set a target request per second, some sort of throughput. And we do have that. Let me just share my screen again. So this is the executors that we have. And I think this constant arrival rate would be the best for that. Because if we look at the example here, you can set a rate here, a requests per second, that is your target. What k6 does is it sends a request or it does one iteration, sees how many requests were sent, and then adjusts the next one, waits a certain time so that before it does the next iteration to adjust to that. So if it already did, you know, 200 requests per second the first iteration, then maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll just do the same thing for the second iteration. And it will dynamically change throughout the test. So maybe at the beginning of the test, response times are faster because not all the users have ramped up yet. In that case, the pacing might be slower because there&amp;rsquo;s no delay on the server side. And so the script is easily hitting the 200 requests per second, but you&amp;rsquo;ll find that later on throughout the test, you may experience higher response times, and in that case, the pacing will be quicker. So that number will be lower so that it still reaches the 200 requests per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s part of what I was mentioning that easiness of. JMeter, I remember before they didn&amp;rsquo;t have that plugin for the throughput, what was the name, I just forgot about it. At the very first times that we started to use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughput controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughput controller, thank you. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have those type of controllers, ways to managing them. And again, bringing the load runner days, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember many useful devices to go through this. And on this case, when you have a scenario that at times when we were designing this workflow, this scenario, we would know, okay, I know that per user, I want that in an hour these many iterations happen. So if you want that, you can use the per vu iterations executor that will help you to quickly configure and manage that, you do have the iterations per user, and maybe you have 10 users, 20 users, you don&amp;rsquo;t care about the number of users. Then you select the shared iterations. I just need this throughput to happen this number of times in this period of time, maybe next time I will have more virtual users, maybe next time I will have less. So you have more control on the end game, to call it in a way, that you&amp;rsquo;re looking for, rather than, and I cannot say this enough, it was a struggle to try to control, and simulate, and reach those goals that you were trying to get in your simulation, and there are so many reasons, as I said, the wait times in between steps were randomized before, as Nicole says, you have the pacing times in between each cycle, and it was so many, like three factors, main factors, I would say, wait time, pacing time, and processing time, each step would add up to that time that there are so many variables that were somewhat random that you could not control. So here you would have some assistance, some help on hitting those goals that you&amp;rsquo;re trying to simulate and having it realistic or on the goal that you&amp;rsquo;re trying to reach, right. It&amp;rsquo;s that difference, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if anyone has gym experience or has ever visited one of those things, but they will tell you, hey, I want to work leg today. Okay, do five repetitions three times. That&amp;rsquo;s if you wanna think of that, how long do you take and do each sit up to go, to give an example, that will be your think time, your wait time in between steps. Okay, you need some rest time before you do the next one. That&amp;rsquo;s the pacing. So for the ones that are not so familiar with those terms, just wanted to throw out that silly example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s one of those things I&amp;rsquo;d like to, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I keep thinking of playing around with, you know, if you look at say HTTP audit logs or something like that, they have a timestamp on there as far as when everything came in. Well, if you take that and use that as the basis to basically replay your activity, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, that&amp;rsquo;s one of the things that I keep thinking about, that would be cool to do, or to have, you know, all your activity going into Kafka, and then being able to repeatedly replay the exact same, perfect storm scenario without having the randomness injected in there. I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I&amp;rsquo;m probably going off on a tangent, but that immediately made me think of that, though. It&amp;rsquo;s like this is one of those things where it&amp;rsquo;s like I always kinda wanna play around with this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that there&amp;rsquo;s a time for that. I think there&amp;rsquo;s a use case for it, but there are also some disadvantages, I think. that people should be aware of. If it&amp;rsquo;s information from a production environment, there are potentially security concerns there for using a user&amp;rsquo;s data to test or a user&amp;rsquo;s account to test. And what happens if that actually gets replayed on their account, which it could be, it, it might not be. Sometimes it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, sometimes sending the same request, even if it&amp;rsquo;s exactly the same, won&amp;rsquo;t work. I think that that&amp;rsquo;s, I think, more experimental, I guess, when you don&amp;rsquo;t really know what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for and you&amp;rsquo;re trying to narrow it down, but I also think that once you&amp;rsquo;ve narrowed it down, it&amp;rsquo;s probably easier and cleaner to script it up so that you can consistently reproduce that scenario. And you can also use test data. Also, you&amp;rsquo;d be able to kind of break it down, you&amp;rsquo;d control all the variables, so you know with certainty that when there&amp;rsquo;s only one thing that changed and it was a negative result, then you know that that was the cause of it. But yeah, I think that there&amp;rsquo;s a valid reason to use that, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, there&amp;rsquo;s definitely data sanitization that you gotta be concerned about unless we&amp;rsquo;re replaying activity on Leandro&amp;rsquo;s credit card, then it&amp;rsquo;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, please don&amp;rsquo;t. Oops, there are 10,000 charges per hour in your credit card. What?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing your credit card. Navin Kumar, whose videos I was just plugging at the start of this has a question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very good question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we intentionally include sleep time in the response time? Now, Mihail, who&amp;rsquo;s one of our developers, if I say something wrong, tell me in the comments, but I believe that there isn&amp;rsquo;t a way, that there&amp;rsquo;s no k6 specific function to do this or option. What I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of is you could create a custom metric because you can create really a bunch of different metrics, counters, and timers, and gauges, and whatever in k6. So you could definitely do that and have that reported and you could set the timing manually, as well. Another thing that I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of is if I had to do this, I&amp;rsquo;d probably just use the xk6 browser extension, because that&amp;rsquo;s already going to include everything, the actual render time. &amp;lsquo;Cause now we&amp;rsquo;re getting, if you&amp;rsquo;re including the sleep time or the think time, this is more like getting into the front-end performance side of things and I think it might just be easier to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was gonna be kind of a question that I wanted to do, too, Naveen. Like why do you want to include the sleep time programmatically that you are generating in your script? I mean, as you say, Nicole, the front end is important to know those render times, those wasted moments in the response or back-and-forth communication, but what are you trying to use it for? It would be very interesting if you can share it. I&amp;rsquo;m curious what&amp;rsquo;s the use. Oh, okay, you were just being creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I think that, yeah, probably if you want to just see front-end experience, I do think it would be more useful if in this case, if you&amp;rsquo;re including it in the response time, then maybe have a constant sleep, actually, because then it&amp;rsquo;s consistent because you don&amp;rsquo;t want the sleep to be influencing your results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did use something like that a long time ago, but precisely to model this workload to calculate. I generally recommend do a small-ish version of the load test that you want to do, let it run for a while so that you can massage those values of how much random time to sleep here, how much random pacing you have here, and how is the response time affected so that you can balance it out. That could be an interesting use, real-life example, but that&amp;rsquo;s a good question, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, injecting a network latency and things like that is always a nice thing for backend services. I mean, with microservices, because one single API call on the front end could be going through 10 different microservices ultimately. And to be able to test something where if halfway through those calls if you have a network hiccup where one of the services is not accessible, but it&amp;rsquo;s, anyway, but it&amp;rsquo;s all one of those things where it&amp;rsquo;s like this feels a little bit more on the chaos engineering aspect of things, you know, how is your application going to behave when something goes wrong? If all of a sudden your network grinds to a halt where it&amp;rsquo;s going really slow, is your application handling that scenario appropriately?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, and on that note, we are actually a little bit over on time already, that went by really quickly. Thank you both for coming and for sharing your thoughts on these topics and also for demoing the k6 cloud stuff that you already had, Paul. Yeah, you are welcome back anytime and I hope we do this again. And for everybody,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that was the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, well, sorry to disappoint you. You&amp;rsquo;re stuck now, like you&amp;rsquo;ve signed the contract, that was it. You didn&amp;rsquo;t read the fine print. Must come to office hours every Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be the last time that you would want me on here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for those of you who are watching, thank you for watching. Thank you for all the awesome questions we got this week and have a good weekend. And if you are in a place where it&amp;rsquo;s very stormy, good luck, hope we all survive it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bye everyone, have a good weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care everyone, adios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being a tester is like being a pokémon trainer: we want to choose the right pokémon for the job. The problem with doing different types of testing is that we also end up with multiple scripts in different languages and testing tools. We end up choosing a squad of pokémon: one for unit testing, one for automation testing, one for load testing, and so on. Making sure they all work together is a task in itself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if we could just use one? What if we only needed one Mega-evolved pokémon that could fulfill multiple roles? Is it really possible to write a browser automation script and then reuse it for load testing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this presentation, I talk about my search for the elusive one pokémon that does multiple jobs, the advantages of hybrid load testing, and how to pick pokémon that make our life as trainers and testers easier.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started using &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; for professional reasons. I use it daily as my main task management and personal knowledge management system for my main job as a software developer advocate at &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io&#34;&gt;k6.io&lt;/a&gt;. However, a surprising use case of mine for Obsidian is playing Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, the tabletop roleplaying game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a video of me walking through my setup for how to use Obsidian to create my own &amp;ldquo;DM&amp;rsquo;s Brain Attic&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week for k6 Office Hours, I talked to one of the newest members on our team, &lt;a href=&#34;https://srperf.com&#34;&gt;Leandro Melendez, aka Señor Performo&lt;/a&gt;, about his experience in joining k6/Grafana Labs. We ended up talking about performance &amp;ldquo;deadly sins&amp;rdquo; and how the practice of performance engineering has changed in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been almost five years since I first moved to the Netherlands, and while I love the country and I&amp;rsquo;m grateful for all the experiences I had here, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to move away. Here&amp;rsquo;s why.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Canonical Observability with Simon Aronsson and Michele Mancioppi (k6 Office Hours #38)</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220121-koh38-canonical-observability/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220121-koh38-canonical-observability/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, my former colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simon Aronsson&lt;/a&gt; brought his &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; colleague, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mmanciop&#34;&gt;Michele Mancioppi&lt;/a&gt;, to k6 Office Hours to talk about observability, and how they do it at &lt;a href=&#34;https://canonical.com&#34;&gt;Canonical&lt;/a&gt;. It turned into a great conversation about trends in observability from the last decade, and how it relates to performance and reliability testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, and welcome back to the first k6 Office Hours of the year. Happy 2022, I&amp;rsquo;m Nicole Vander Hoeven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;m Simme, we&amp;rsquo;re back from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;m Michele.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simme is back. Yes, so Simme unfortunately is only temporarily back, and he&amp;rsquo;s brought his new colleague. I mean, I&amp;rsquo;m kind of sad, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to meet you Michele Manciopi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome. Simme why don&amp;rsquo;t you first tell everybody, how you betrayed us at k6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry for that, was a couple of months ago now. I think I quit at k6 in October, beginning of October something like that, to join Canonical and Michele, where we are trying to build a really awesome observability stack to know little part built on top of Grafana products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it has been a very interesting three months. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a pretty refreshing to be able to use high quality software and compose it in ways that are, you know, they just work through, cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we already have a few people in the peanut gallery, there&amp;rsquo;s Simme and Michele and our newest colleague, I think senior performer, all saying hi to you Simme. so you&amp;rsquo;re very much missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to k6 for bringing Leandra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, and by the way, Leandra will be on k6 Office Hours next week, he just accepted the invite. So when I&amp;rsquo;m letting him like relax, and do his bootcamp onboarding things, and his week of load testing this week. . Ooh Danielle is here as well. Michele, why don&amp;rsquo;t you talk about yourself, and what you do at Canonical?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I am a product manager at Canonical, for observer BD team. I was brought in with the goal of making the entirety of the product line of Canonical observable. Canonical is chiefly known for Ubuntu, but we have like a meter other products and they all need to be observable because they all sit at different levels of critical pieces of the infrastructure. Before Canonical, I was the technical product manager at Instana, which has been what baby ham it&amp;rsquo;s a product that does very automated observability. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly proprietary, but it was a lot of fun trying to make observability the way it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be. That is seamless. Very easy to roll out. Before that I was at SAP where I was the technical lead of the performance team for SAP cloud platform, where my job was mostly to figure out where things were slow and fix it. And then I realized that rather than helping one single developer at the time, would they be more productive in actually providing pretty decent tools to do that at scale so people could do it themselves, which then brought me down the path of figuring out it&amp;rsquo;s actually fun here to make an observability product than it is to using one. And then the CircleCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Simme what was it about Canonical that won you over?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually think it was to no little part Michele won me over with his argumentation for&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. I&amp;rsquo;m taking him off the stream sorry. No, no, No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Cause I got you everyone, bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. We&amp;rsquo;re still all friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do really miss the k6 family for sure. But yeah, it was just such a cool and exciting opportunity to be able to make this huge leap in observability with Canonical, for such a vastly used project or suite of tools and products. So that&amp;rsquo;s mainly one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. Can we stop to remark? That was the coolest cup I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in a long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is as if this is sponsored, this is a hydrate spark, it&amp;rsquo;s a smart water bottle. And it&amp;rsquo;s marketed like for people like me because it&amp;rsquo;s a water bottle, but it has Bluetooth and LED light. So, you know, obviously I had to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, just out of curiosity, what are the key values of the Bluetooth support?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, it tells me when I need to drink water. It&amp;rsquo;s very important stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you monitor that A, the Bluetooth is working and how do you receive those notifications?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s funny that you ask, there is an app for it. This is totally not sponsored. Okay. But there is an app for it. I was gonna say Simme that it seems like there was a slight change in your focus as well, because at k6, we&amp;rsquo;re more focused on the performance and reliability testing part of it. But definitely we&amp;rsquo;ve also dabbled in the observability space, especially with the acquisition of Grafana. So it seems like your new role is also more focused towards observability. Was that one of the considerations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure it is. And then that was definitely one of the considerations during my, what is it now? 12 or something years in tech, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing way more observability and monitoring work than I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing performance testing. And so that definitely felt like coming home in a sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I wanna ask you both this because you&amp;rsquo;ve both been in observability for awhile. How do you think observability and performance testing go together? Do you see them as separate disciplines entirely, there&amp;rsquo;s clearly some sort of overlap, right? Should companies be doing both, one or the other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely think there is a lot of overlap. One thing that I know that you and I have been pushing forward when we&amp;rsquo;ve been discussing this previously on the stream is that performance testing is great, but it usually only allows you to do a black box perspective testing, right? You&amp;rsquo;re able to measure the performance of your system, given certain interfaces or end points that you are able to observe the performance off and pairing that with observability tools, like for instance, loci or tempo, or Prometheus&amp;rsquo;s allows you to really drill back into the stack and figure out what is causing those problems. So I definitely think that it makes sense to combine the both to be able to observe the whole system and not just the edges of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you agree with that Michele?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, very much, over go and say that actually, it&amp;rsquo;s very hard to draw a demarkation between the performance and of observability, especially since in the last few decades and the increasingly disproportionately larger role that internet and internet systems taking our lives. We have come to see, you know, slow as the new down, which means that not only the software needs to work but it needs to be fast. And if you observability is fundamentally the art of understanding, are there problems? I mean, so how bad was impacted and how badly, and that is both in terms of software, it is broken as software is luck. Many of the techniques that you would use in, for example, a QA system to check the scalability of your software is something that you can use at scale in production to make sure that you&amp;rsquo;re at least carrying that much load, as well as techniques for example, for performance testing, you often do a lot of black box monitoring. The techniques that you use to check if today in SIL on a mobile connection, your web store is reachable is very similar in terms of technologies and capabilities and as technical requirements. So the technology is there to use, to throw a lot of requests security to your software. So it&amp;rsquo;s fundamentally the performance tools are versatile like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I totally agree with that. I have always taken the stance that it&amp;rsquo;s definitely better when you have both of them because observability is great. But then in pre-production environments, it can be a little tricky &amp;lsquo;cause you don&amp;rsquo;t have real traffic and that&amp;rsquo;s where performance testing can come in handy and performance testing is great, but you don&amp;rsquo;t always want to run it in production. And also you, it&amp;rsquo;s not always a good idea to be reliant on the results of the performance testing tool. You know, sometimes it makes a lot more sense to be already using the same observability stack that you use in production. And I also want to call out that performance testing is often thought of as load testing, but that&amp;rsquo;s really just one kind of performance that is being measured there. And so what about a related topic to observability as monitoring? I know Michele, you have a lot to say on that topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh my, can I rant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Go ahead. I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with your blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooh influence. I have a &amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do research, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought you came across it because, you know, super rabid spike. No, the, so I have been around the observability industry for awhile and I have a certain annoyance towards what the industry has done by rebranding perfectly good monitoring and application performance tools in terms of the hot new term up observability that you need to sell to sort of the software. The way I see it&amp;rsquo;s a much more formal, shall we say way. Observability is a property that you want your systems to have, monitoring is the way that we have to make most systems observable. However, something that I hope we will see in our lifetime, our software systems and such a level of quality and standardization in our profession of creating software systems. So that monitoring and observability becomes build team in the softwares we create. If you think about it all the for example, automatic distributed tracing and all the amazing innovations that have occurred over the past 15 years are effectively reckoning the lack of observability as a functional requirement of a piece of software. Monitoring is the art to collecting data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and I think that there&amp;rsquo;s also a connotation of monitoring being a bit more passive. Would you agree with that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily, no. At the end of it so there is, I really take the view that monitoring is a means to the end of observability. It is true that in the past few years, with new generations of tools, we have made leaps and bounds in both the capability of collecting useful telemetry with very little work in terms of toil to roll it out, without the proper tools are there and I used to work for one where you deploy an agent and it automatically discovers all around it. There is a lot of dark magic going on, but it works. And then it becomes very cheap to actually get to the holy grail of monitoring that is to have as little silos as possible. Telemetry wants to have friends. You want to see end to end systems how they relate to one another. Now, the moment that something that has changed recently in the industry is we have gotten better, not only at collecting telemetry, but analyzing it. When you compare monitoring tools that we started with right there the Nagios of the world. You&amp;rsquo;ll need it to know in advance what you were looking for. Now with broader collection of telemetry, for example, distributed tracing, a very powerful type of telemetry, very little underutilized in terms of the insights can provide you, you end up having a lot of data that is likely going to be useful, and you have much more freedom in how you analyze it, both in terms of discovering issues as they occur, as well as afterwards in terms of post-mortem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have, however one, I agree with you completely Michele. I do however, think Nicole has a point in that if you look at the traditional monitoring tools that people used to use, like Nagios for instance, it was always this very weird situation where you put up SNMP traps or collected, you know, logs that were thrown at you in a very passive manner. But I would say that it turned monitoring itself has come to evolve into a state where it very much is an active practice in the same way as people would describe observability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh. So you are making a very interesting distinction of rather than receiving as a data sync telemetry that was emitted, but something else that you go and get it through RTI, things like deploying an agent that does stuff. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Or for instance, actually triggering a synthetic test that just prompts a common user flow and make sure that that still works. I mean, as compared to just admitting this passive telemetry data that just keeps rolling on, but maybe lacks the context as you put it on more advanced workflows where you&amp;rsquo;d correlate multiple sources of data or the multiple actions to derive your data that you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that in the past 15, 20 years, there has been an increase of active monitoring. I remember doing it back in the day with smoke tests that were of a crunch up every 15 minutes. I was so young. And now it&amp;rsquo;s that it&amp;rsquo;s kind of a baseline of observability. I mean, you need to want to catch everything, but if there is catastrophic failure, you will know hopefully before someone starts opening tickets or you&amp;rsquo;re upping your drops. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I think Simme it was right when he was saying, what I was talking about was like the more traditional approach that it&amp;rsquo;s just something that&amp;rsquo;s there in the background whereas these days, the way that it should be done is a lot more proactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also they focus on actually gathering telemetry to be able to detect failure modes rather than probing for a certain thing. It used to be much more focused on a single point that you would probe for data. And&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It used to have simpler software too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sure did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure. But I also wanted to say that there&amp;rsquo;s also been, there&amp;rsquo;s still some push based monitoring, but we&amp;rsquo;re also now seeing more poll based monitoring systems, more event driven ones. And I think this is all the evolution of monitoring and observability, right? Because these things did not exist not too long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, the one should, it is pretty true. We have much more pool and pool length. This is something that a permit use has pretty much popularized with the concept of scraping, but there are entire domains where we deploy a software that is still very much push based. For example, IOT, for very basic reasons of network visibility, it&amp;rsquo;s very hard to go and reach out into someone else&amp;rsquo;s rooftop and go get the data. So there is still the mechanics of push buffer and pulled it for example, gave us in the primitive ecosystem, push gateway mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grafana agent that actually sits in between you and a cloud service or something else, and allows you to not punch holes in your firewall, but rather reach out and deliver data to something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of like you mentioned that our applications in general are just getting more and more complex, it reminds me the push the trend from monolith to microservices and then now some people are also going back. It&amp;rsquo;s never really gone, right. And it&amp;rsquo;s really difficult to say, no, this is the new way, nobody else is doing or should do the other way. It&amp;rsquo;s not really like that. A lot of things in tech are cyclical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I actually spoke about our systems are getting more complex. I was thinking exactly of micro services because we made a trade as an industry for very, very simple, very small components. And then pushing all the complexity that you cannot make disappear under the carpet of service meshes, many containers, things that need to be versioned independently remain compatible, which is actually one of the main drivers why in the observability industry, we moved from the very traditional, I don&amp;rsquo;t like the word pillars, but the very traditional telemetry types of logs and metrics with the occasional sprinkling of profiling to rather extensive use of distributed tracing because all of a sudden the problem was less often in the single simpler components and much more often in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is kind of a funny conversation to me &amp;lsquo;cause I don&amp;rsquo;t know if you remember, but 10 years ago we used to talk about microservices as well, but then we called it service-oriented architecture and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the new cool thing. And then we decided that that was kind of cumbersome and powerful to work with. And we started to merge together our software, again, introduced monoliths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a service record architecture, we tended to have a very expensive, very large piece of machinery called the enterprise service bus that actually was providing to some extent that kind of visibility that today we need to have through tracing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let&amp;rsquo;s also not discount the effect of the proliferation of cloud providers, because when you have your own data center and your audiences, maybe your internal company or something, maybe it is a good thing to go from one huge complex monolith to three simpler services. But when it&amp;rsquo;s not three, it&amp;rsquo;s like hundreds, maybe then you start needing like another layer to orchestrate and manage and all of the traffic between each of those components. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely not that clear cut to say which one is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely think you&amp;rsquo;re bang on in that case, Nicole, &amp;lsquo;cause we&amp;rsquo;ve moved from maybe having a couple of software devs for a company that did some kind of HTML that website with some access database backend in the worst cases, right? We now have these huge teams of hundreds of developers that are all working on a compost system together. And having that as a monolith would in practice require us to either do these huge orchestrations of release trains that no one is able to do in a proficient fashion. Or we would have to have downtime all the time &amp;lsquo;cause we would need to redeploy everything every time we made a change. So in that sense, it really makes sense to split it up as we grow our teams and we grow our development efforts as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a rather, so coming from a very enterprise background I have a rather newest feel to be on the subject. And my take is that usually technological problems are not technological problems, there are people problems. One of the main motivators that was towards going to the extreme distribution of microservices. &amp;lsquo;Cause I tried to fight back against the Conway&amp;rsquo;s law. The fact that roughly the architecture of your system mirrored the architecture of your organization. So we said, look, we have all these teams, these pizza teams, it&amp;rsquo;s very hard to make them cooperate to create a well-behaved monolith. So let&amp;rsquo;s give each of them their independent infrastructure and talk over standardize protocols like most of the HTTP and some sort of RPC built on top of it. And that would provide for them a way to be productive independent of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an industry, we dramatically underestimated the cost and complexity that comes from the need of coordination and compatibility and understanding among these teams, because now you no longer have one code base that you can run tests against. You have to have multiple ones that may interact surprisingly at Atlanta. These for example, has led to introduction of contract based testing, where teams contribute to each other interface tests. And there&amp;rsquo;s also the saying, which is something that is a harsh reality that every observable behavior of an application with a large enough user base, will become a dependency for somebody somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is the whole premise of Conway&amp;rsquo;s law, right? The idea that our architect, the software architecture or the infrastructure that we put into place in a lot of ways starts to evolve depending on how our team is structured. And I think it&amp;rsquo;s both a technological and a human problem as well. When you talk about coordination between teams or between services, it&amp;rsquo;s really the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. We have made actually strides in how easy it is to make software inter operate with each other. If you go back, we started, we were talking about SOA. SOA came with a curse called SOAP. It was incredibly complicated, mindbogglingly hard to make run at scale. Today, we have a bunch of, so we are using HTP for other things. Sometimes I would think too many, we have good stuff like GRPC, like arrow, a lot of different protocols that can be very efficiently used to either make a synchronous message passing happen or synchronous invocations. We have a lot of tools that in the past year and half, I think we&amp;rsquo;ve got the big two trigger happy in deploying a lot of new tools in production. And I&amp;rsquo;m saying this with a background of someone that fundamentally had to support every single piece of technology that made input or output, for example, on Java. It would surprise you how many different HTTP clients for Java are I think in production, I lost count. There were 50, it&amp;rsquo;s insane. And I&amp;rsquo;m, for example, you raised your mark right with a very, very beautiful LED and Bluetooth. And it&amp;rsquo;s super cool. I feel&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to share something that Simme was sharing there, but I can&amp;rsquo;t actually see it for some reason. Oh, there it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s this Simme?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love to say, I like to bring out this picture whenever we talk about why observability is needed. &amp;lsquo;Cause while it&amp;rsquo;s a lot larger than most of us operate with, and it&amp;rsquo;s still very striking that they think this is supposed to be Netflix&amp;rsquo;s is a microservice architecture at some point, whether it is or not, I don&amp;rsquo;t really know, but it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be and trying to&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I be trashy? Can I be able to trashy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architecture has an element of deliberation that they do not believe there&amp;rsquo;s an actual out of the system has, this is an emergent system is a lot of architectures that then meshed into something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s remarkable that it works so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And one of the cool things there, I think is the fact that without observability where this big ball of yarn, it would be completely unfeasible to reason about anything this system is doing at scale. You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to reason about the particular part, maybe that you are working on one of these small dots that we can&amp;rsquo;t even see because of all the lines. But to reason about what it does is as a whole would be completely unreasonable. But with tools like, for instance, distributed tracing, we&amp;rsquo;re suddenly able to follow end to end an action of a user or an agent within this system. That was all I wanted to think of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love distributed systems, distributed tracing in distributed systems, because it actually gives you the means of answering the most important question or you&amp;rsquo;re faced with an issue, who is affected and how badly? When you go on an enterprise setting and our people are often databases service, your application completely blowing up, could be a drop in the bucket of their system. They will not probably have the central entry you have to have a very different take on priorities unless you have agreed upon a slice on the silos and the failure that you are fundamentally up streaming through your users may not be their concern, but the moment you have the shooting tracing, that goes from the deepest database to the device in the face of your user, yet you have a very clear perception of how bad is something that is the one most important piece of information that you need in front of your face when the pager goes off again at 3:00 AM, you need to decide whether it&amp;rsquo;s time to go on to Batman, or if it can wait until the third coffee tomorrow morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;rsquo;s the real success of the &amp;ldquo;Squid Game&amp;rdquo; right? Because that image that you had up Simme, and just imagine that times 114 million users that are potentially using many of those systems, it&amp;rsquo;s amazing that it works at all at that scale, especially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that always gives me those thoughtful moments of, oh my God, what are we doing as an industry? Is that a potentially simple issues have disproportionate impact on popular services to the life of many, many people. It goes from lack of entertainment. You&amp;rsquo;re there you want to see the latest, &amp;ldquo;Witcher&amp;rdquo; episode, cool stuff. You&amp;rsquo;re disappointed if the thing is on top, multiply that by a medium people that cannot get there, there are fix, Hey, you have a significant amount of life around that has gotten worse, but it goes also to something that is maybe much more limited, but much more tragic. For example, when I was working at SAP, one of our customers was, I cannot say the country, but it was the first aid response service of one of the countries. We were scared plus that something so important that either the platform, because downtime would have consistent consequences to real people, something that we have seen recently with the move to the cloud and the disproportionate role that for example, U.S system one has on everybody&amp;rsquo;s life today. We have seen how the risk is getting more and more concentrated into fewer and fewer, very large, very complex, very reliable, but critical pieces of infrastructure, in ways that I do not believe as a society we have had yet. And that is where it really humbles me as an engineer to think, well, this has to work, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. We went through that in, I think in the last k6 Office Hours, I had somebody from oil funk, who is an emergency services provider in Austria, and it was cool, but also a little scary to find out that they are using k6 for, in part to also handle the traffic from the 112 emergency hotline. So it&amp;rsquo;s cool to see something that you&amp;rsquo;re working on, be used in such a critical industry, right. But at the same time, it&amp;rsquo;s also a little scary because it could actually be lives that are lost if you know, we don&amp;rsquo;t do our jobs well enough, it&amp;rsquo;s a little humbling to think of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the closest resemblance we&amp;rsquo;ve had to these critical infrastructures that everyone relies on would it be like the transatlantic Telegraph cable? I mean, that has like in, I think it&amp;rsquo;s currently 19 cables or something like that, that make up the transatlantic telephone cable. But I really any catastrophic failure there would really isolate us in terms of cross continental communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is less likely to result in loss of life. Then, for example, your neighbor want service, not being able to follow you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for having completely spoiled the mood. I think that as an industry, we need to go in deserve the role of engineers. If we built bridges the way we push software to production, in some cases, I don&amp;rsquo;t think anybody would cross a river without crossing themselves first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s interesting is in that spaghetti soup of microservices that you showed Simme, now we&amp;rsquo;re seeing that our observability stack is part of those. They are also contributing back to the system that we have to monitor. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if either of you saw the post-mortem by roadblocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was classic. I had ops to them. It&amp;rsquo;s a, we have all been there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes yes. Do you have to talk about it Michele?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I would be able to be nearly as good as a Simme for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just came to be honest. So I don&amp;rsquo;t have any detail commentary on that either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the classic fallacy of oh jolly, oh golly. The same infrastructure that is powering my observability system was probably the system that went down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right. All right. Yeah, that really is something that you&amp;rsquo;ll see a lot. I mean, for instance, say that you have a deployment of the classic Grafana suite somewhere, and you have that running in the same data cluster maybe, or at least the same cloud provider as you have your critical workloads and to make it even worse, you could go down to having it in the same geographic region, or even on the same cluster nodes or the same hardware that you&amp;rsquo;re using for the rest of your critical infrastructure. When something goes south there, in terms of your critical infrastructure, it is likely that that was all will also, as I think, where to kick would roadblock, spill over to your monitoring system. And if that happens, how are you gonna be able to tell that you&amp;rsquo;ve been hit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the classic blast radius question. Everything has failure modes, actually, several of them, and the more abstractions we deploy, the more failure modes we introduce, for example, Simme and I are building an observability system based on Kubernetes natives. Our guidance is if you deployed, deployed to a different cluster on different hardware, because you should never put the monitoring system on the same infrastructure, close to the infrastructure stuff we monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not only that. We also usually recommend that if you deploy our monitoring system, deploy another monitoring system that makes sure that your monitoring system is up and set them up in a, what did they call it? That dead mans trigger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dead man switch is the idea that, for example, do you know in the movies when the hero goes in front of him and says, if you kill me, you will be exposed in two days time. That&amp;rsquo;s the classic deadness which is something that happens unless someone periodically goes there and tells him not to. In this case, in the case of monitoring is unless your system, your monitoring system is telling you that it&amp;rsquo;s fine, assume tragedy. It never goes to the level of a specific use cases, but first of all, you need, let me take a step back. The best monitoring system is the one that tells you whether it&amp;rsquo;s something to look at, right? You actually do not want to have dashboards, however, colorful and beautiful in front of your face all the time, unless it is for Ferguson purposes, you actually want to be able to focus on something else and jump into the action when stuff is hitting the fan. In order to do that, you must have the guarantee that is the easy model of notification. You will receive it because silence, you want to know that it means that it&amp;rsquo;s good. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to doubt if there is something going on that my sister should tell me but doesn&amp;rsquo;t, which is why you set up fundamentally a health check thing that says I&amp;rsquo;m thinking here and all it&amp;rsquo;s fine. That is the diagnose switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it so interesting to read through the post-mortem and props to them too, by the way, for releasing something so detailed, they were not afraid to, you know, say what they&amp;rsquo;d done wrong and what they were doing to address it. I thought it was really well-written, but I want to read one part of it, because I thought it was so good. They said, &amp;ldquo;There was a circular dependency between our telemetry systems and console, which meant that when console was unhealthy, we lacked the telemetry data that would have made it easier for us to figure out what was wrong. We&amp;rsquo;ve removed the circular independency, our telemetry systems no longer depend on the systems they&amp;rsquo;re configured to monitor.&amp;rdquo; I thought that was a great takeaway from that whole incident. And because they&amp;rsquo;ve shared it in the post-mortem, they&amp;rsquo;re not the only ones who can learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very generous of them to expose themselves that way and actually left the rest of the industry learn from their mistakes. And so hard work as you said, Michele, our love to the team at the roadblocks who probably need needed a bit of time out after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is also another component of a human component here. They did the right thing. They reestablished trust. They are telling us, we learned from our mistakes so that you can as well. In the scope of monitoring systems, trust is the ultimate currency because a monitoring system is literally a measurement system for the health of other systems. If you cannot trust your measurement system, what is the point of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you usually only get one go with that as well. If you burn that trust, it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be very, very hard to build up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is something that touches me very personal because I used to work on a solution that was exquisitely powerful, but therefore also very complicated and complex. And the moment you have automation, someone somewhere sometimes is going to be broken by it. And reestablishing that trust was never easy and sometimes impossible depending on the scale of failure that you&amp;rsquo;re well-intended means of automatically monitoring something I should have brought to the customer. Something that we seldom say as an industry, when we try to sell a product to somebody else, is that everything has a cost. If you want to take away complexity from you to roll out very simple systems and set up that thing, reports stuff over there, and you want it to automatically, there&amp;rsquo;s a higher risk that the automation will cause an issue. Of course, that in many cases is a justified risk. You can roll out the monitoring gradually and the easier it is to roll out a monitoring system at scale, the more you reach the holy grail of monitoring, that is the network effect. The moment that you can start observing how issues in systems propagate, correlate, or are not correlated there is something very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s talk a bit more about the characteristics of a good observability stack. We&amp;rsquo;ve already mentioned a few we&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned that, it should be independent as much as possible from the systems that they&amp;rsquo;re trying to monitor. We&amp;rsquo;ve also said that maybe we should also take into account the human side of things rather than just the technological. Maybe you should tailor the complexity of your observability stack to the size and experience and structure of your teams. What are some other things that you both could name in your ideal observability stack?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I really like to highlight here is the ease of use or the economics of the system that you are using. I used to do a analogy to how EpiPens work for people with allergies. If you&amp;rsquo;re eating a peanut and you&amp;rsquo;re allergic to peanuts, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to assemble the cure for that, right. Or something that alleviates or takes you out of immediate danger. You need it to be simple, just as take it out, push it in your leg, and it&amp;rsquo;s done. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to think about it. The same goes for monitoring or observability systems as well I would say. If you have to, when you&amp;rsquo;re awakened by a notification in the middle of the night, and maybe you&amp;rsquo;re even hung over or worse, and you are supposed to fix something that is critical, and you have to start thinking about what to do, then your observability system has in my eyes, at least failed you, you need to be able to get a notification that says this is wrong, here&amp;rsquo;s the data that proves that, click here to get a closer look and just be presented with all the information you need to be able to make a decent decision on how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing recently on that note that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across is how potentially easy it is for a new Blake me to set up a whole observability stack or at least monitoring, but he could definitely expand upon it is EBPF, because we&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about distribution of systems and also of observability related services, but there&amp;rsquo;s also a trend of going lower and lower level, right? And EBPF monitoring is monitoring at the kernel level, recently with some people from the k6 team, Artem Charlie, Kevin, Danielle, Lopez, shout out to those guys. We did this hackathon project actually for EBPF monitoring. And the whole reason that I got into it was because the promise was you install this binary, you drop it into your cluster on your local machine. And then it just kind of exposes magically all of these things that I normally would have had to set up like node exporters for, you know, it was we&amp;rsquo;re living in a golden age of monitoring and observability I think. The things that are possible, like I can&amp;rsquo;t even keep up anymore, be talking about ergonomics. I mean, what is more ergonomic than not having to do much of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are talking about the day one, the fact that it is so easy to set up apart from monitoring system is exactly what you need to be able to monitor at scale. It removes the thought. EBPF is a fantastic technology. We are fundamentally given a virtual machine to run inside the kernel to execute logic, that allows us to do in a centralized place. Things that in the past were almost impossible. For example, the first thing I ever did with a team of vinyl in Stanhope with EBPF was actually to detect how a process that, that was impossible in user land. But with EBPF, it was actually pretty simple. We literally spent more time making sure that the techniques would work across all the operating systems that we need to support and to figure out how to find out that. EBPF the, I see two big potentials for that, for things that are not possible already today with sufficient tips. The first one is to give us a distributed tracing tool that largely independent from their own time. Now there are technology limitations there. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to find out how to trace context. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that someone somewhere out there is figuring it out as we speak, probably, that we reduce to some extent the toil that is necessary to support the federal fire hose of new technologies, libraries, and stuff like that is put in production every day. But the second one that excites me even more because the shoot the tracing is largely already possible is actually to have cheap enough in terms of overhead and consistent enough across run times production profiling. People look at distributed tracing as a way of figuring out what is slow. And it works remarkably well as long as the bottleneck is in between processes, the moment you want to drill down, why this requests into the insight, this process was taking too long. You see what you&amp;rsquo;re tracing is not so suited anymore. You end up looking at the leaf instead of the forest, because there is so many more requests going on through the system, that unless you have a lot of spans that are very, very detailed and fundamentally to trace threat level profiling, you are not going to which costs a huge amount of overhead. You are not going to have the information needed to find out, okay, good stock in the Dow library again. However, the moment that you have things, basically you have to find out where the CPU, memory or location, memory usage and wait time hotspots are in your application. You actually have the first places to work at to improve the overall system. It&amp;rsquo;s not gonna tell you why that request was going badly, but the moment you saw the hotspot, you are virtually guaranteed that many requests are going to get better. And then you can measure them again in terms of input output, observability tracing. Now people out there are going to say, Michele, what the hell are we talking about? Today we have a lot of amazing technologies to the production profile and they are true because for example, they are right because for example, if you look at the Java virtual machine with, for example, the Java flight recorder, you have excellent facilities with super low overhead to figure out what is your Java or cuddling or cradle program doing true. But they&amp;rsquo;re very specific to the particular run time and to a particular programming language. And when you start comparing what wait time, for example, looks like in Golang as respected over to machine with code routines, instead of, I dunno, loom threads, project loom, and all the rest of the stuff, you end up actually having telemetry that seems to say the same things, but in reality has a different semantic. And that is a challenge in our systems that have more and more grown polyglot. When we had the, our happy little monolith fault, it was one language. Now this year the systems are implementation of many different languages that behaves differently, and yet they are operated in some cases by roughly the same people, for example, necessarily teams, right? Having fluency in terms of performance across several languages is a significant challenge. Now, if we actually get through EBPF production profiling, for example, the folks behind parka and also the folks we have big pixie, there&amp;rsquo;s an amazing job there. If we manage to have something that will give us close enough, precise enough production, profiling information across whatever we may wanna throw into a container that is going to be a generational change in terms of making complex systems run better at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s something that we&amp;rsquo;re interested in at k6 as well. I mean, I&amp;rsquo;m a performance Sesser so the first thing I think of as the network side of it, there are a lot of network metrics that could be gathered at that level. And the reality now is that without EBPF, you&amp;rsquo;re in this position where each new service has needs some other exporter that you need to install. And like there&amp;rsquo;s so many plugins to plugins and many different combinations of things, when really they might all be using HTTP. Like, why don&amp;rsquo;t we have something that just detects, maybe not, it won&amp;rsquo;t be everything right. It&amp;rsquo;s never EBPF has never going to completely be able to, or, well, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t say never because you know, that could change very quickly, but I don&amp;rsquo;t see it as being the end all be all solution. But if it can provide some of the more common metrics, that&amp;rsquo;s already a step in the right direction. Talk about usability and ergonomics right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also provide a safe assessable baseline across a lot of different technologies working together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. For sure. What other things do you think would you have in your ideal observability stack?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You asked me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either of you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead Michele, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of ideas on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, actually, if you go on the, okay, can I make us most shield for a link? If you go on google, WWW.ubuntu.com/whatisobservability/whatisobservability. There you see a kind of overview of the things that I find most meaningful, monitoring different types of systems. Second, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna give here that your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can share my screen record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume you want this one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. So this page is fundamentally a work of love of Simme and I, about the way we see observe a PVT. And the diagram that you see on screen is a, of course, simplified and very generic can your manage me if I lie, but it is a thirst overview of the kind of telemetry that you use at different levels in your infrastructure in order to monitor things. This is important for filamentary two reasons. One, is to provide guidance for people that may be new to observability in terms of which things to focus first, when you look at the telemetry types that are used on the right hand side, you will see that metrics and logs are of course universal. That&amp;rsquo;s what we started with. They are very good. Every software that deserves to run somewhere is capable of emitting clogs. Most of them can emit metrics and more and more, thanks to primitives that is really proud. There are the metrics sometimes serious thing to the forefront of enterprise systems. It didn&amp;rsquo;t used to be that. Then you start seeing that profiling gets, for example, the moment you move above the virtualization hardware, and you start talking about processes and applications, profiling them makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry Michele for cutting you off. But I think you might need to need to explain the icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s really. We don&amp;rsquo;t have that context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, they don&amp;rsquo;t explain themselves. Maybe then you use amino the icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the chart that you see on the left hand side is metrics, mentors, time series fundamental. That&amp;rsquo;s what we use to monitor things. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot. Then the table with the reds and greens and yellows followed by text that locks, the old, that bar chart is actually supposed to be flamed charts and that&amp;rsquo;s profiling showing hotspots. The strange thing with all those horizontal bars that is distributed tracing, that is the best way I can come up with to visualize spans. Spans is the basic data structure in distributed tracing. It describes an action taken by system to process a request. For example, you would have a span for the receiver of an HTTP request. The span is opened is created when your HTTP server is receiving the request, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be closed, but it simply is doing amazing things to get to the image in a screen&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of this you&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen in your browser, was what I was about to say, like something similar when you browse on webpage, you&amp;rsquo;d get this span alike view of how the different correlate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s similar, but there is a key difference. One of the key concepts of distributed tracing as coming from dapper, which is fundamentally the progenitor of all modern distributed systems is the parent-child relation between spans, which is the closest you can get to cow&amp;rsquo;s reality. We are, for example, when your application is receiving an HTTP request and is issuing your query to Mongo to retrieve some data, you will have a parent&amp;rsquo;s span for the receiver of the HP request. And the child&amp;rsquo;s span that says, I spoke to Mongo, took me this longer. And this query, I got so many data back that is the parent-child relation. And it fundamentally, you would not have spoken to Mongo if not for the incoming request. Now things get Merck here when we talk about a synchronous messaging, because the beauty and simplicity of the trees of spans that you have in synchronous systems, kind of get lost with a messaging the moment that you have batch consumers. You&amp;rsquo;ll have many requests that result in a whole bunch of messaging being queued up in your messaging queue. And one application consuming messages originated in different traces all at once, fundamentally creating a merge, but I digress. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. So we were talking about&amp;hellip; I just get so excited about this future tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it&amp;rsquo;s great. I know that you said that you have a hard stop and I&amp;rsquo;d like to get you off a little bit early for your meeting Michele, but why don&amp;rsquo;t you talk about what Canonical has to do with observability at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, can I call does a lot of things, including a very beloved operating system together with an amazing community of volunteers, Ubuntu, we are responsible for a huge amount of software. We have offerings for Kubernetes, for OpenStack, for SAF, for a lot of systems that people use to run their applications and data centers. And it is the mission of Simme and I to make sure that those systems come with excellent monitoring capabilities, that you can monitor them with open source software, whether or not you want to use the monitoring system that Canonical provides you. At the end of the day, what we&amp;rsquo;re doing is in variable source fashion. We want to make sure that all the appliances that you can get from Canonical, the SAF, the OpenStack, the Kubernetes is, there are the cube flows and all the machine learning. They are, you can monitor them with best-in-class open source monitoring tools like videos, like getting logs out of SIS log, the security traces with open telemetry, where it makes sense. And that is the part of the work of Simme and I, that is about stepping up the game in terms of making software provided by Canonical observable in a way that you can use, for example, with your existing monitoring system, we really believe every single word we say, when we say the metric, once France, it&amp;rsquo;s all about having radio systems be monitored together. Now, if you do not happen to have a radio monitoring system, wherever monitoring the rest, we can give you one, but if you have a monitoring system and you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable with it, you by all rights should be able to monitor whatever piece of software you get from Canonical with it. And this is what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s awesome. I wish we had more time to talk about this, but maybe we can have you both in some future episode, I feel like there&amp;rsquo;s so many things that I wanted to dig deeper into, but thank you both for coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am so happy. Simme I&amp;rsquo;m so happy to have you back on again. I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed doing these with you, so it&amp;rsquo;s a little bit weird that you&amp;rsquo;re now on as a guest, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy that you&amp;rsquo;re also bringing things that you&amp;rsquo;ve learned at Canonical back to us. And Michele welcome. I&amp;rsquo;d love to have you&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back again for sure with or without Simme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anytime. But Simme is finer yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure. Sure. Thank you everybody for watching and I guess we&amp;rsquo;ll see you next week. Bye everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bye, have a wonderful day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In December 2018, my husband and I met up with some friends and went from Valkenburg and Maastricht in the Netherlands to Riga, Latvia; and then to Tallinn, Estonia. Three countries in one day!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Overview of Software Testing</title>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: What is the difference between good software and bad software? Is it features or user interface or marketing? In my totally biased opinion, what actually makes a difference is how well the software was tested. But software testing encompasses a lot of different areas and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even always have to be someone with a word tester in their job title that does the testing. So whether you&amp;rsquo;re looking to get started in the industry, or just trying to cross skill, here&amp;rsquo;s an overview of the main types of software testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it just me, or does your desk get that clutter too after a week of work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, software testing is the process of validating whether an application works as intended, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of vagueness in that statement. One of the broadest ways to categorize testing types though, is whether it&amp;rsquo;s functional or operational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional testing is more about application features. Is there a form to capture user email addresses? Is there a button next to it that submits those addresses? Once the button is clicked, where do the user details go? Do they go to the database? Are they stored correctly? Those are the sort of ways in which functional testers think. Operational testing traditionally called non-functional testing, is a way of verifying software quality and aspects that extend beyond the features of the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operational testing sometimes involves concerns that are more subjective or qualitative. So it can be a little bit more difficult to test, because those things only arise in certain conditions. I&amp;rsquo;m saying operational testing here, instead of non-functional testing, because I was talking to Paul Bruce who made an excellent video just on this topic. He talks about why the term nonfunctional requirement is really a bit of a misnomer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAUL: It relegates all these other things, security, performance, installation, deployment, accessibility. It relegates them to a nice to have, so it should be functional versus operational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So I&amp;rsquo;m using his term operational testing instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the different forms of operational or non-functional testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First there&amp;rsquo;s accessibility testing. It is involved with verifying that end users can consume or navigate content. Usually through assistive devices like screen readers. While most forms of testing begin with a statistically normal user in mind, accessibility testing seeks out outliers in terms of location, linguistic background and disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usability testing is designing with user experience in mind, specifically concerning the placement of on-screen elements and the intuitiveness of the process flow of an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Localization testing is a way of making sure that applications are usable in the local context, in the sense of being colloquially appropriate for users in different countries and from different cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security testing verifies that a system has no flaws that could be exploited, to gain access to confidential information or features that would not otherwise be accessed by expected means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that was me talking from my home in the Netherlands, but this week I am in Portugal. The remote working life, am I right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway, performance testing is my favorite topic and my favorite type of testing because that&amp;rsquo;s the one that I&amp;rsquo;ve had the most experience with. Performance testing is more qualitative. So it&amp;rsquo;s more about how well the application works. And there are two main types of performance testing and that&amp;rsquo;s front-end performance, and back-end performance testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Front-end performance testing seeks to verify the user experience at the interface level. So that&amp;rsquo;s everything that the end user sees on their local machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different approaches to front-end performance testing, and the first of them is performance profiling. Performance profiling involves running your application through a series of automated checks. And there are a lot of sites for this, where you just put in your URL, if it&amp;rsquo;s a web app, and you get a score in the end. That tells you how performance your application is, the most popular example for this and also the easiest to get started with, is DevTools because that&amp;rsquo;s already in Chrome and Firefox based browsers. But you can also go to sites like Webpagetest, or GTMetrix, YSlow, which is a plugin, or you can use Google Lighthouse, which is now included with Chrome Dev Tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next approach to front-end performance testing is called RUM or Real User Monitoring. So the difference is that with performance profiling, that&amp;rsquo;s often done manually, and as a one-off thing, like maybe at the beginning of a test or during, but Real User Monitoring is not usually done within testing environments. As the name suggests, these tools measure the experience of real users. So they have to be run in production. Examples of tools in this space are; New Relic&amp;rsquo;s RUM, Elastic has a RUM as well, there&amp;rsquo;s Catchpoint, SpeedCurve Uptrends and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the third approach to measuring front-end performance is by using some sort of browser-based automation tool. So typically this has been something like Selenium, but that&amp;rsquo;s falling out of favor in terms of more modern solutions like Playwright, Puppeteer, Cypress and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So front-end performance is about everything that the user sees on their end, but back-end performance testing is about everything that they don&amp;rsquo;t see. It&amp;rsquo;s about the network. It&amp;rsquo;s about latency, the application servers, the way the infrastructure is set up and all of those things that are a little bit more difficult to look into, but can also have severe bottlenecks. Back-end performance testing seeks to verify aspects of an application such as scalability, elasticity, availability, reliability and responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scalability is the application&amp;rsquo;s ability to respond to changes in demand. This could mean scaling up, which means increasing the resources available to a server, but it could also mean scaling out, meaning increasing the number of servers that are available to handle the application load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elasticity is a related topic to scalability, except where scalability is all about scaling up or out. Elasticity also emphasize a scaling down or in, and that&amp;rsquo;s because having these services or servers available on the Cloud that are dynamically adjusting can also be quite expensive. So elasticity makes sure that the infrastructure that&amp;rsquo;s available or the resources available are always appropriate for the size of the demand. So when demand increases, elasticity also checks whether the application decreases it servers or resources in response to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Availability is how long the application stays up, despite changing circumstances in production. So this is typically measured by uptime. Availability can also be tested using disaster recovery procedures, and you&amp;rsquo;re not just testing the application itself, but also the processes around it. So are there enough people that are on call so that they would be able to come in and troubleshoot when there&amp;rsquo;s a production incident? All of those things are included in application availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliability checks to see how your application behaves in response to unexpected errors. Reliability basically takes it as a given that your application is going to fail somehow, sometime, maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly when that will be or how it will fail, but it&amp;rsquo;s going to happen. So a big part of reliability and site reliability engineering is trying to expose your application to those failures beforehand so that you can build confidence about how it will behave when those things actually happen in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the last aspect to back-end performance testing is responsiveness. And this is usually equated with load testing. Load testing is more of a technique for testing though. And really load tests can be used to test not just responsiveness, but also reliability or availability or scalability, basically any of the &amp;ldquo;ilities&amp;rdquo; in this part of back-end performance testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protocol-based load testing verifies the backend performance of an application, not by simulating real users accessing the application, but by simulating the underlying requests that go back and forth between the client or the user and the application servers. One of the benefits of protocol-based load testing is that it takes up fewer resources on the side of the load generator, and therefore is less expensive to run. Some popular protocol-based load testing tools are k6, JMeter, Gatling LoadRunner, NeoLoad, and Silk Performer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browser-based load testing verifies the application by simulating real users accessing it. So it also has the benefit of including these front-end performance metrics. Browser-based testing can also be called browser-driven or UI-based testing. Some popular tools for browser-based load testing are Playwright, Puppeteer, Flood Element and as of a few weeks ago, k6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;rsquo;s hybrid load testing, which takes the best of protocol and browser-based load testing tools by combining them in one test. Now this can present some challenges, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re using different tools for the browser-based script, than you&amp;rsquo;re using for the protocol-based script. The ideal is to use your protocol based load testing tool, to simulate majority of the load to cut down on costs for the execution and scaling out of your load test. And then you run a handful of users using your browser based load testing tool. So you still get some metrics for front-end performance while that load is being applied by the protocol based tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing software can be really daunting because there are many aspects of an application that you can test. But that&amp;rsquo;s because there&amp;rsquo;s also many aspects of an application that can fail. And that&amp;rsquo;s why all roads lead to testing and why the success of an app hinges on how well it&amp;rsquo;s been tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to zero in, on load testing in particular, check out this video that I made on what load testing is. Thanks for watching. And like they say, here in Portugal, Obrigada!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you set goals in Obsidian?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Year&amp;rsquo;s Resolutions are infamously left undone. So what should you do instead? OKRs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting OKRs (Objective Key Results) instead of resolutions increases your chances of succeeding. Tracking your progress throughout the year also make sure you&amp;rsquo;re getting things done. In this video, I talk about what OKRs are and how I&amp;rsquo;ve set them up in Obsidian for the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this k6 Office Hours, k6 CEO Robin Gustafsson joined me to talk to Daniel Knittl-Frank, a software engineer at Eurofunk, about how k6 is used in the emergency services industry. Daniel has an interesting use case for k6: he uses it to load test calls in Austria received from the 112 emergency services hotline!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Last year, Pokemon GO, a mobile app developed by Niantic Labs, made $1.23 billion in revenue with 166 million players from all over the world. This level of success is unprecedented, especially for an app that was encouraging people to go outside at a time when many governments were encouraging them to stay inside. In tech, though, success comes at a cost. Here&amp;rsquo;s what Niantic has to do under the hood to keep this massively popular game running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, I&amp;rsquo;m Nicole van der Hoeven. I&amp;rsquo;ve been helping companies
through their load testing for over 10 years, and I like to talk about tech travel and taking notes. I&amp;rsquo;m also a Pokemon GO player. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing it since
the day it was released in July 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be reacting to a conversation between Priyanka Vergadia from Google and James Prompanya from Niantic Labs. Thank you to Joe Colantonio&amp;rsquo;s TestGuild News Show last month, for bringing it to my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: Yep.
NICOLE: Okay. Everybody knows that you should be doing a curve ball to catch Pokemon the fastest way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: I am catching some Pokemons. Did you know that it was
built on Google Cloud? Well, let&amp;rsquo;s talk&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: GCP, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: At Niantic Labs to take a behind the scenes look at Pokemon Go&amp;rsquo;s architecture, and how it scales for large number of players. Hi James, welcome to the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: Pokemon Go is not your typical mobile game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I love that he&amp;rsquo;s got Pokemon paraphernalia everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: Catching these little creatures around you called Pokemon that are
appearing in a real world. Encourage you to go outside, explore and discover things using augmented reality. A big part of that, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t in&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: See this is one of the things that make me really impressed with their implementation. They have majority of their users using mobile networks. That&amp;rsquo;s a really hard thing to account for, especially when you&amp;rsquo;re talking about a global audience that is playing in different parts of the world. So it&amp;rsquo;s really important that everything is front-loaded, and that they&amp;rsquo;re minimizing the amount of traffic, the amount of resources that each player has to download on their mobile network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: Wasn&amp;rsquo;t included in the game when it first came out, was this big community aspect of it. We really liked this part of the game. So we made it a major part by hosting regular live events, such as Community Days, Raid Hours,Team GO Rocket Takeovers, all culminates in this big summer event that we call GO Fest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: So it&amp;rsquo;s&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So this is a really brave move as well because they have events that are timed. So they happen at the same time for people in that time zone. And earlier on in Pokemon Go&amp;rsquo;s history, I did experience some slowness and some congestion in the mobile networks. But I mean, that&amp;rsquo;s a really difficult thing for them to plan for. I&amp;rsquo;m interested to see how they solve that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: How does Pokemon Go back and actually scale to handle these peaks in traffic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: So we use Google Cloud. (chuckles) We have lots of services that need scaling such as the Google Kubernetes Engine and Spanner. Our front-end service is hosted on GKE, and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to scale the nodes there. Google Cloud provides us with all the tools we need to manage the Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So it&amp;rsquo;s really cool to hear him talking about their stacks. So they&amp;rsquo;re using GCP, Google Cloud Platform. They&amp;rsquo;re on Kubernetes, so they&amp;rsquo;re using GKE, the Google Kubernetes Engine. And they use Google Cloud Spanner, which is a very highly available relational database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: To give an idea of scale, we have about 5,000 spanner nodes handling the traffic and thousands of Kubernetes nodes running just for the Pokemon&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: That is so interesting. 5,000 Spanner nodes. That&amp;rsquo;s just for the data. That makes sense because Niantic&amp;rsquo;s main reason for creating this game, or the way that they&amp;rsquo;re making money, I guess, is by getting the data from users about walking paths and &amp;hellip;Basically, geo location or spatial data. So it&amp;rsquo;s super important for them to be able to store the data that they&amp;rsquo;re getting from their application usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: We also have the various microservices that host other parts of the&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So another thing that they&amp;rsquo;re doing to keep it scalable is
by using microservices. See the traditional way is to use a monolith, so one large application with many sub-components. The problem with that though, is you can&amp;rsquo;t independently scale those components, you&amp;rsquo;d have to scale the entire application. And when that application is already really big and complex, that&amp;rsquo;s really inefficient because you&amp;rsquo;re scaling everything, even services that you
may not need to scale. So it&amp;rsquo;s really smart that they&amp;rsquo;ve chosen for a microservices based architecture, so that each of those components can be scaled separately of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: And if you compare ourselves to maybe World of Warcraft, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that other massively multiplayer online games, they split players into multiple realms, but for us, all of our players, they reside on a single realm. It was important for us that players can always interact with each other and share the same game, the experience, no matter where or when they&amp;rsquo;re playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: Yeah&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Okay. So I happen to have also played WoW, World of Warcraft. My main &amp;rsquo;toon was a disciplined priest. So when you sign up to WoW, you have to choose a realm, that&amp;rsquo;s basically a server or group of servers so that they don&amp;rsquo;t have to shoulder the entire load from all users. So that was WoW&amp;rsquo;s way to reduce the load. And he&amp;rsquo;s making the point that Pokemon Go can&amp;rsquo;t really do that to a certain extent. It&amp;rsquo;s not entirely correct to say that they don&amp;rsquo;t have
that sort of splintering, because they do still splinter based on the time zone. You&amp;rsquo;re only seeing people in that location in your time zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even events, they sometimes say 10:00 AM in your local time. So you&amp;rsquo;re not necessarily playing at the same time that people in Australia are playing. So there is some splintering, but it is less than what there would be for a game like WoW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: When we&amp;rsquo;re looking at different providers, we saw that Spanner
has consistent indexing that allows us to do more complex database schemas with these primary and secondary keys. Data Store was also non-relational with atomic and durable transactions. So we needed a relational database with full consistency, and made the choice to go to Spanner, which gave us these global ACID transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So he&amp;rsquo;s talking about consistency, global consistency, being a big deal and a big factor for why they chose to go and use Google Cloud Spanner instead of Google Data Store. And the reason is that normally, when you have a bunch of different instances of database, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter so much that those requests are processed in exactly the order that they came in. Because usually those
requests are being made by different people, and they&amp;rsquo;re trying to change different accounts. But with Pokemon Go, there&amp;rsquo;s the added complexity of wanting to keep the integrity of the chronological order. So if I go and attack a gym before you do, my, the process, the request that I created by attacking the gym, should be processed before yours is because it matters who gets to the gym first. So that&amp;rsquo;s an interesting twist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: Now let&amp;rsquo;s say I&amp;rsquo;m a player and I&amp;rsquo;m playing the game right now. I open my app to catch a Pokemon. What is happening behind the scenes? How does the request flow work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: When the user catches a Pokemon, we receive that request through the Google Cloud Load Balancer. All of the static media is also stored on Google Cloud storage buckets. And it&amp;rsquo;s downloaded to the phone when you first start the app. We also have caching enabled at the load balancers. So it&amp;rsquo;s&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Already, they&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned they have a load balancer, so that that&amp;rsquo;s like a traffic controller that&amp;rsquo;s sitting above the servers and saying, &amp;ldquo;Okay, this request goes to this server.&amp;rdquo; And then maybe when that server is processing too many requests, that load balancer should be able to say, &amp;ldquo;All right, now let&amp;rsquo;s
divert some of the traffic to another server that maybe isn&amp;rsquo;t as heavily utilized.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also mentioned that they employ caching. This is what I was saying earlier that because you want to minimize the amount of traffic and the bytes that are flowing on the network, you want to employ caching for maybe things that
aren&amp;rsquo;t going to change so more static assets. Maybe you might want to change the Pokemon that&amp;rsquo;s in a gym, but the location of that gym is something that should and can be cached. He&amp;rsquo;s right now talking about caching on the server side, on
the application side, and not on the mobile phone. But I wonder if they&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about that later as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: It&amp;rsquo;s all cached and served through Google Cloud CDN. So when the Poke&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So he also mentions using a CDN, so a Content Delivery Network, which is really good because that means that if I&amp;rsquo;m in the Netherlands and I make a request to their servers, my request isn&amp;rsquo;t then going to be sent to a server in the US, because it&amp;rsquo;s going to be sent to one of the servers in my country or nearby. That means that the latency between my request being sent, and that request getting to the server, and retrieving that resource and back, is going to be a lot lower. So it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; This is a way to improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: The player catches the Pokemon, the GCLB sends the request to our GKE cluster. And we have a front-end service that sits behind Nginx reverse proxy. The request goes from the user&amp;rsquo;s phone through the reverse proxy, to one of these player, front-end services. We also have this thing called a Spatial Query Backend. It&amp;rsquo;s a cache by location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that is where we store the information that determines where a Pokemon is shown on the map, what gyms and Poke stops are around you, what time zone you&amp;rsquo;re in, or any other feature that is location-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: Now, what happens when I hunt a Pokemon down and catch it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: When you catch a Pokemon, it sends the request to the front end, to the Spanner database, where your player entity is stored and it store it there. For catching Pokemon, that actually doesn&amp;rsquo;t go to the Spatial Query Backend. If you were, instead, if you were battling in a gym or adding lures to the Poke stop, that information is stored on the Spatial Query Backend, and&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Okay. So it sounds like the Spatial Query Backend is only storing data about the world, the Pokemon Go world that everybody can see. So people don&amp;rsquo;t need to know whether another person has caught a particular Pokemon. They just need to know whether there&amp;rsquo;s a lure on a Poke stop, or whether the gym is Team Mystic and things like that that everybody else can see. So there&amp;rsquo;s this segmentation of some data that is specific to the user, and other data that all users need to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: We also use Pub/Sub to send the message to a Pub/Sub topic, which is then used for analytics pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: He talks about a Pub/Sub model, which means that their architecture is event driven. So the traditional way that this is handled is by polling. So normally when an service is waiting for something to happen, it goes, and it sends a message and it checks. Basically like, &amp;ldquo;Hey, are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then when it finally gets a response that &amp;ldquo;Yes, we are,&amp;rdquo; then it can do something with that data. Instead what they&amp;rsquo;re doing as a Pub/Sub. So instead it waits for events. There is no constant polling, again, reducing the amount of traffic that&amp;rsquo;s going back and forth. And it just specifies criteria for what it is actually waiting for. And when that happens, after the services that require that event are subscribed, then that event is published to all of them. And then they can then do whatever they want with that event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: So, how do you ensure that when two people who are in the same geographic regions, see the same Pokemon data, and keep that relatively in sync, especially during the events?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: So it&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty interesting. Everything in our servers are deterministic. So even if players are on different machines, they&amp;rsquo;re sensitive to
different front-end services, if they&amp;rsquo;re in the same physical location, all the inputs would be the same and the same Pokemon would get returned to both users. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of caching involved and as well as precise timing, especially when the settings are changed and they need to be in sync across all the servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s very tricky, but it was very important for us that all the players feel like they&amp;rsquo;re part of this one shared world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure what he means when he says that it&amp;rsquo;s deterministic.I&amp;rsquo;m going to guess, and I have no relationship with Google or with Niantic, but I&amp;rsquo;m thinking that what he means is that when you&amp;rsquo;re catching a Pokemon, there is no request that&amp;rsquo;s being sent to the servers to say, &amp;ldquo;Hey, did I catch this?&amp;rdquo; Instead, there&amp;rsquo;s probably some sort of algorithm. This Psyduck is caught 80% of the time and appears 2% of the time. So 2% of the Pokemons that you&amp;rsquo;re gonna see appear in this area, are going to be Psyducks. And that&amp;rsquo;s also reducing the load going back and forth, right? Because it&amp;rsquo;s just the equation or the algorithm that determines whether you catch a Pokemon or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: This game data is of interest to our data science team. They use this for marketing purposes, for verifications. For example, we might want to say that this player, or players caught x millions amount of Pokemon during our Saturday Community Day events. So, it&amp;rsquo;s important that we have that information in an easily accessible manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of data here that they track. So I&amp;rsquo;ve got my distance walked, Pokemon caught, I&amp;rsquo;m at 18,878. Poke stops visited, total XP, start date. And then there are these medals as well. So, they look at things like, how far have you walked in total? So all of these things are data points that they store for every single user. No wonder they have such a focus on databases, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: As the events grow, like you mentioned, in some of these events, the traffic grows to millions of users per second. You also said&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Per second!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: &amp;hellip;of data is generated. How does the system scale when it comes to data pipeline?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: Yeah. So when there&amp;rsquo;s increase of transactions, there is increase of load
throughout the system with a lot of our data pipelines for things like BigQuery, one of that&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I&amp;rsquo;m not actually sure she was saying millions of users per second, but that&amp;rsquo;s a little bit ambiguous. Maybe she meant millions of requests per second. And the way that they&amp;rsquo;re trying to do that is they&amp;rsquo;re reducing the size of those requests. If she means there are millions of concurrent users at any given time, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean that those users are all doing something at the exact same time. So I would have wanted to see exactly how many requests, to hear
how many requests per second they&amp;rsquo;re needing to deal with, or how many bytes per second are being sent over the wire. That would&amp;rsquo;ve been cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: &amp;hellip;Just works. Google Cloud will handle the increase in traffic without any intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: With that much traffic, obviously health of the system is critical as well. How do you monitor the health of the system during these massive events?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: So we use multiple monitoring systems, including Prometheus, Grafana, and Google Cloud monitoring. On a personal level, I actually prefer it to Google Cloud monitoring because it&amp;rsquo;s very simple to use&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Whoo whoo! And they&amp;rsquo;re using Prometheus and Grafana &amp;hellip; Oh, this is entirely unexpected, but I&amp;rsquo;m actually wearing a Grafana shirt. So it&amp;rsquo;s really cool that they&amp;rsquo;re using Prometheus and it really, it makes sense, because they&amp;rsquo;re on a Kubernetes cluster and Prometheus and Kubernetes just go really well together. By the way, I work for Grafana, for context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: What are some of the expansions and improvements you&amp;rsquo;re looking to do in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: On the Google Cloud side of things, we are looking into things such as Agones and Google Game servers, and using that to see how we can make our game even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: We wish you and the Niantic team best of luck for these enhancements. And this has obviously been super insightful for us, James. Thanks for joining me today and sharing your architecture with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: Yeah, thanks for having me. This was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: That was really good. So there were a few things that were mentioned there for how they&amp;rsquo;re scaling Pokemon Go, that I wrote down here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One, they use an event driven architecture and also a microservices based architecture, both of which are way more performant than the traditional methods.And the microservices based architecture will also let them scale up independently as demand increases as well. And they&amp;rsquo;re also using Cloud Spanner instead of Google Data Store, prioritizing global consistency, as well as high availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They front-load a lot of the static assets that are used by the application. And they&amp;rsquo;re being downloaded when the app is initially downloaded or installed onto users&amp;rsquo; mobile phones. That way they don&amp;rsquo;t have to keep serving the same data if it&amp;rsquo;s going to be used consistently. And when something changes, like a different lot of Pokemon, they release these patches that let you download a lot of those images so that when you catch those Pokemons, then you already have all that information on your phone. And on a related note, they&amp;rsquo;re employing a lot of caching. They talked about caching on the mobile app side, and on their server side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events are also staggered. So splintered realms sort of, because they&amp;rsquo;re happening
on different time zones, depending on where you live. And not completely simultaneously, regardless of the time in the part of the world where you&amp;rsquo;re from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re also using things like Prometheus, Grafana and Google Cloud Monitoring. They didn&amp;rsquo;t mention how they&amp;rsquo;re actually using multi-tenant versions of Prometheus like, maybe, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if they&amp;rsquo;re using Cortex or something like that, but that&amp;rsquo;s something that they should look into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they also mentioned potentially increasing the number of Google Game Servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really appreciated that behind the scenes look. I wish more companies would do this, especially for apps that I personally love and use. One thing that I&amp;rsquo;m really curious about though, is the testing side of it. Because testing an application of this scale and complexity, is another thing entirely from observability. And I would have wanted to know how they&amp;rsquo;re doing their performance and load testing. And whether they&amp;rsquo;re doing things like chaos engineering maybe, or reliability testing to improve the availability and reliability of their application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re still watching this, then chances are high that you like Pokemon and load testing as much as I do, which is a bit of an odd combination. And in that case, check out this video, on how I run chaos experiments using k6, Prometheus and Grafana. Thank you for joining me as I watched this awesome video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as they say in the Netherlands, (Dutch) Until next time! Bye!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve previously talked about how &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210930-non-lazy-dms-use-obsidian-for-dnd/&#34;&gt;non-lazy DMs use Obsidian for D&amp;amp;D&lt;/a&gt;, and a few weeks ago, I participated in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20211009-ttrpg-obsidian-showcase&#34;&gt;TTRPG Obsidian Showcase&lt;/a&gt; with a few other Obsidian DMs and players.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, at &lt;a href=&#34;https://grafana.com/go/observabilitycon/2021/k6-load-testing/&#34;&gt;ObservabilityCON 2021&lt;/a&gt;, we announced something new: k6 now supports browser-based testing with xk6-browser. Here&amp;rsquo;s a few of us from the k6 team talking about the announcement!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was really excited to have Hans Knecht on this week&amp;rsquo;s Office Hours. Hans works at Mission Lane, and is one of the biggest contributors to a k6 extension called k6 operator. k6 Operator lets you create a k6 custom resource object in Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this week&amp;rsquo;s k6 Office Hours, we attempted to steer into Halloween by talking about some of the most common performance testing issues we&amp;rsquo;ve faced in our careers as performance testing consultants. For this one, I had Tom Miseur join me to commiserate and swap stories.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s Office Hours, I wanted to talk about the intersection of Site Reliability Engineering and performance testing, so I decided to invite two people with different backgrounds from me to discuss it. Stephen Townshend is a performance engineer who recently changed jobs to become an SRE, and Daniel González Lopes is an SRE who had not had experience in performance testing before he joined k6. It turned out to be a great talk!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know that every new person to k6 does a Week of Testing? It&amp;rsquo;s a k6 tradition for new hires to spend their first week seeing firsthand what the experience of a new user of k6 is like. How quickly do they find the documentation? What issues do they get stuck on? Then, at the end of the week, the new employees do a presentation for the rest of the team to show their first impressions and findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s Office Hours, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/inancgumus&#34;&gt;İnanç Gümüş&lt;/a&gt;, one of the newest k6 team members, shares his presentation and his experience as a k6 beginner. Another colleague, Viktor Mihajlović, a Technical Customer Success Engineer, also shares some of the most commonly asked questions he&amp;rsquo;s heard on the job.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to make load testing scripts realistic</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20211014-realistic-load-testing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A good load testing script exercises the functions and components as specified in the requirements gathering phase while simulating real users as closely as possible. Here are a few ways to make scripts more realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

      <title>Basics of load testing with k6 and Grafana in 20 minutes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a video I pre-recorded in preparation for &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20211005-testing-with-k6-and-grafana-better-together/&#34;&gt;the first Grafana EMEA virtual meetup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gvounvDSDGg&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-June (just three months ago), k6 joined the Grafana Labs family. Many people didn&amp;rsquo;t quite understand what the connection was between k6 and Grafana, but I thought it made a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s Site Reliability Engineering book talks about 4 golden signals that we should measure in a system: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Load testing provides 3 of those (latency, traffic, and errors), but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show saturation, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t give us visibility into the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grafana brings observability. k6 brings data. They work really well together, which is why we&amp;rsquo;ve been using each other&amp;rsquo;s products for a few years now, before there was ever any talk of an acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about why k6 and Grafana are better together and also demonstrate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to run a simple script in k6 OSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to make sense of the results of a load test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test execution options: running locally, sending results to k6 Cloud, and running a test from k6 Cloud&amp;ndash; all triggered using the CLI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;two different integration options to bring k6 and Grafana together: the k6 Cloud Grafana data source plugin and Prometheus Remote Write&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a presentation I participated in about a bunch of nerds who like both &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; and D&amp;amp;D. My part begins around &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovqu_1aW3Sw&amp;amp;t=2720&#34;&gt;0:45:20&lt;/a&gt;, but I thought the other speakers&amp;rsquo; parts were really fascinating as well!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this Office Hours, I invited my colleague Tom Miseur and friend Leandro Melendez, aka Señor Performo, to talk all about different criteria in performance testing, including non-functional requirements, SLAs, SLOs, SLIs, thresholds, and checks. Criteria at different levels is how we determine whether testing, including performance testing, has been successful, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand what they are and incorporate them into testing scripts and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re learning a new skill, there&amp;rsquo;s only so much that studying can do. The problem is that there&amp;rsquo;s still a big gulf between studying something and doing it yourself. The solution is having a mentor to bridge the gap&amp;ndash; someone who will let you shadow them while they&amp;rsquo;re executing tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made this video thinking about the me from over a decade ago who would have wanted to get the chance to look over a more experienced tester&amp;rsquo;s shoulder. In this video, I talk about how considerations for planning load testing, using a hypothetical use case for a real company: &lt;a href=&#34;https://wyrmwoodgaming.com&#34;&gt;Wyrmwood Gaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this first EMEA session of the Grafana Labs virtual meetups, I talked about how to use k6 and Grafana together to get the full performance picture for a software application. Observability, using tools like Prometheus and Grafana, lets us see what&amp;rsquo;s going on inside the application, and load testing, using k6, helps us get those insights earlier on in software cycles, such as during pre-production.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bill Rainaud is an inside account executive at k6, which means he talks to users and potential users of k6 every day. In this Office Hours, he explains how to get started with load testing using k6 Cloud, which is a SaaS platform for running and scaling up load tests on the cloud. We also answered a few frequently asked questions about k6&amp;rsquo;s capabilities and how to do correlation in k6.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My co-host &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I had invited Adron Hall from &lt;a href=&#34;https://hasura.io&#34;&gt;Hasura&lt;/a&gt; to come talk to us about how to load test a GraphQL API, but he was unable to come due to unforeseen circumstances. Luckily, Tom Miseur, who is part of the Professional Services branch of k6, was able to step in on very little notice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom has done a load testing engagement using k6 that involved Hasura, so he was able to tell us what it is and how it can be tested with k6. It turned out really well, thankfully!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight I did a webinar with Grafana Labs&amp;ndash; the first k6-related webinar since the acquisition. I was more than a little nervous to give it, because I knew I was introducing k6 to a lot of new users, but also to Grafana for the first time. I think it went pretty well! I was still quite relieved when it was over, however. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the webinar, I talk about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why it&amp;rsquo;s still a good idea to do load testing in pre-production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what k6 is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why k6 and Grafana together make sense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and how to integrate k6 and Grafana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s quite a bit of demo in it, and I also had the k6 CEO, Robin Gustafsson, join me for Q&amp;amp;A as a nice treat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

You can also go through my slides &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WOA50nqIv1NoiHBxGIH_JM02rZqSjX81gHTlwPJ5i1U/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;rsquo;d like.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I gave a presentation at New Relic&amp;rsquo;s FutureStack conference about &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210730-schrodingers-pokemon/&#34;&gt;chaos engineering with k6 and New Relic&lt;/a&gt;. A few months ago, k6 got acquired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://grafana.com&#34;&gt;Grafana Labs&lt;/a&gt;, and so I wanted to redo it, but with the Grafana stack this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the result, and I think I like this iteration even better:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I presented this talk at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSgH3I8_ldk&#34;&gt;TestCon Europe 2021&lt;/a&gt; today, although the audio sync issues were not great, so I recommend you watch the video above instead.&lt;/p&gt;

Apparently, they began using k6 internally some time ago, and because they like to eat their own dogfood and use GitLab to test GitLab, they also incorporated k6 into GitLab so that their users could reap the benefits, too.&lt;/p&gt;

Lee is the CEO of &lt;a href=&#34;https://utopiasolutions.com/&#34;&gt;Utopia Solutions&lt;/a&gt;, and he&amp;rsquo;s been in the testing industry for decades, so I really appreciated his insights on where the industry is going.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tommiseur/&#34;&gt;Tom Miseur&lt;/a&gt; joined k6 at about the same time I did late last year, and we immediately hit it off because we both come from a performance testing consulting background AND we both had worked for different competing testing tool vendors before moving to k6. I was excited to have him on k6 Office Hours to talk about a topic we both had a lot to say about: how to debug load testing scripts, and specifically k6 scripts. We got a chance to do a bit of a show-and-tell of tools that we use that we use, and they are all independent of k6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wireshark.org&#34;&gt;Wireshark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.charlesproxy.com&#34;&gt;Charles Proxy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://proxyman.io&#34;&gt;Proxyman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got to demo &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/benc-uk/k6-reporter&#34;&gt;a cool HTML reporting dashboard&lt;/a&gt; that Ben Coleman, a k6 user, created. While it&amp;rsquo;s not baked into the tool itself, it&amp;rsquo;s fairly straightforward to add it, requiring only two snippets of code that can be pasted onto any script.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, my colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gonzalezlopes.com/&#34;&gt;Daniel González Lopes&lt;/a&gt; joined me as a co-host on k6 Office Hours, and we interviewed &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kelvzhan&#34;&gt;Kelvin Zhang&lt;/a&gt; about his thesis at Imperial College London, using k6 to test microservices-based architectures. He created something called Kubedim, an application that intelligently applies non-uniform brownout theory to intentionally dim application requests for the purpose of improving overall availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a dense Office Hours to digest, but Kelvin really impressed us with his experiments and findings! It&amp;rsquo;s definitely an awesome use case for k6 and just a great one to watch for any site reliability engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another travel vlog from safer times: in September 2018, my husband and I took a friend out to Grotten Sint Pietersberg, a fortress and cave system in Maastricht, the Netherlands. They had been used in the times before that area was not yet part of the city of Maastricht; they were in a small village called Sint Pietersberg that had gotten caught between several invading foreign armies and the people of Maastricht. We enjoyed the day out!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Running a load test is half of the equation, and not having the right observability tools to see how your application responds to the load can sometimes flat-out invalidate a test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how to install open-source tools Grafana and Prometheus on a Kubernetes cluster in DigitalOcean and how a performance user could use them for increased visibility during a load test.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this episode of k6 Office Hours, I got the k6 Chief Technical Officer, Pawel Suwala, to give a bit of a behind-the-scenes of how we work at k6 and what we&amp;rsquo;re working on next. We talked about the methodology we use for building k6, the different teams we have, and exciting new features that are coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In September 2018, while my husband and I were in Sofia, Bulgaria, we decided to try some delicious Bulgarian cuisine by going on the Balkan Bites free food tour, which let us try Bulgarian relish, yoghurt, doughnuts, cheese, and desserts. Afterwards we went back to one of the restaurants we had gone to on the food tour to have a full meal, which ended up being very delicious. Along the way, I talked about how ilearned the Cyrillic alphabet, and why I thinks it&amp;rsquo;s worth learning even for a short trip like this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We really enjoyed the &lt;a href=&#34;https://balkanbitesfoodtours.com/&#34;&gt;Balkan Bites food tour&lt;/a&gt;, so if you want to join as well, check them out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s the website for the restaurant we ate at, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kashtite.com/en/&#34;&gt;Hadjidraganov&amp;rsquo;s House&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Schrödinger&#39;s Pokémon: Observability for chaotic load testing (New Relic FutureStack)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a presentation I gave at &lt;a href=&#34;https://newrelic.com/futurestack/speakers/nicole-van-der-hoeven&#34;&gt;New Relic FutureStack 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploying an application to production is often like putting a pokémon in a box and hoping it manages to stay alive despite real-world chaos and potential outages. What can we, as testers, do to prepare applications for these situations before they go live? In this talk, I discuss chaos engineering concepts and demonstrates how to apply them by incorporating load tests with chaos experiments and setting up observability tools to watch it all happen. Because without observability, how can we tell whether Schrödinger&amp;rsquo;s pokémon is alive or dead?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We haven&amp;rsquo;t travelled since January 2020 for obvious reasons, but fortunately (?) I have a whole lot of footage taken from trips pre-pandemic that I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet turned into travel vlogs. In case you weren&amp;rsquo;t aware, I learned a lot of what I know now about creating videos from making travel vlogs for friends and family as my husband and I travelled around the world for months at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a trip we took in September 2018. We had just finished off a trip to Greece with some friends from Australia, and on the way home, I decided to book a three-day stopover in Sofia, Bulgaria&amp;ndash; a city I really knew next to nothing about. Here&amp;rsquo;s that first day!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the acquisition of k6 by Grafana Labs, the entire k6 team has been absorbed into the new, larger team that we&amp;rsquo;re suddenly a part of. Grafana Labs maintains a lot of projects, so I was very quickly overwhelmed with things to learn about all of them. Here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt to make sense of the Grafana Labs landscape, and perhaps it can help some of you as well:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a fun little vlog that I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to make of the last trip my husband Rob and I took before the pandemic. In January 2020, we went to see my cousin and her daughter (my &amp;ldquo;niece&amp;rdquo;, whom I grew up with) in London. My niece, Steffi, had just arrived in London for some studies abroad (she normally lives in the Philippines), so Rob and I popped over to meet up with her and help her settle in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poor thing&amp;ndash; not a month after Steffi got to London, news of the pandemic began to spread. Rob and I had intended to visit her again, but of course that didn&amp;rsquo;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to run distributed load tests with k6 Operator (k6 Office Hours #21)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s Office Hours, &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I talked about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/grafana/k6-operator&#34;&gt;k6 Operator&lt;/a&gt;, which is a open-source project that Simme created for distributed load testing with k6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 Cloud already offers a no-hassle distributed load testing experience, but for those who prefer to use their own infrastructure, k6 Operator allows the setup of a k6 test as a custom resource object that can be deployed along with a Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuous testing means verifying and improving software quality at all stages, including development. It can sound like something only large companies do, but it&amp;rsquo;s an approach I use even for this personal blog that you&amp;rsquo;re reading this on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every new blog post or change I make to this site automatically triggers the execution of a small test. This test, when run over time, lets me see whether changes I&amp;rsquo;ve made have been detrimental to site performance. Here&amp;rsquo;s a video on my setup:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;José Luis Latorre Millas, Developer Community Lead and Software Architect at Swiss Life AG, joined &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and me on k6 Office Hours to talk about how he personally uses k6 with Azure DevOps to add load testing to his team&amp;rsquo;s CI/CD pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to know José from the k6 Community Slack workspace when he mentioned that he would be presenting on k6 in a few meetups. I went to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HITJg03AQFo&amp;amp;t=112s&#34;&gt;his livestream with CrossDvlUp&lt;/a&gt; (Spanish) and enjoyed his approach, so I knew I wanted to have him on. It&amp;rsquo;s always great to have real users of k6 (both of the OSS and the commercial Cloud option) talk about how they personally use k6 and even what they found lacking in the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on k6 Office Hours, &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I were joined by two CEOs: k6 CEO &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinegustafsson/&#34;&gt;Robin Gustafsson&lt;/a&gt; and Grafana Labs CEO &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nopzor&#34;&gt;Raj Dutt&lt;/a&gt;. It was a little nerve-wracking to have two CEOs on the stream, but it did give us the opportunity to ask both of them pointed questions on Grafana Labs&amp;rsquo;s acquisition of k6, including any plans they have for how both companies could integrate better in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, during Grafanaconline 2021, &lt;a href=&#34;https://grafana.com/about/press/2021-06-17-grafana-labs-brings-modern-open-source-load-testing-to-observability-with-acquisition-of-k6/&#34;&gt;Grafana Labs CEO Raj Dutt announced&lt;/a&gt; the acquisition of k6&amp;ndash; the company I work for. What does this mean? Here&amp;rsquo;s a video I made to explain it all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/t1agJsLwrGE&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I have also discussed the acquisition twice on k6 Office Hours:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrDo2wMeV80&#34;&gt;once with our CEO, Robin Gustafsson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and another time with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWIB-myito&#34;&gt;both Robin and Raj, Grafana Labs CEO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DW: We unanimously agree it&amp;rsquo;s a positive thing. I myself am cautiously optimistic about the future of both k6 and Grafana Labs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kevinohashi&#34;&gt;Kevin Ohashi&lt;/a&gt; joined me and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/FloorDrees/&#34;&gt;Floor Drees&lt;/a&gt; on k6 Office Hours to talk about how he used k6 to &lt;a href=&#34;https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/&#34;&gt;benchmark the performance of WordPress hosting providers&lt;/a&gt;. He talks about the difficulties he ran into while trying to keep tests repeatable and consistent, and I also make some suggestions for how he could improve his load testing script for future comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of particular note for me in his results was how clearly the performance of the hosting providers varied depending on the location Kevin had selected for his load generators. One in particular showed a significant delay when a site was fetched from Sydney, indicating the possibility of a lack of a CDN server in that region. It made a great argument for load testing in the cloud, from different geographical regions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On this week&amp;rsquo;s Office Hours, &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I were joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinegustafsson/&#34;&gt;Robin Gustafsson&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of k6, to make a big announcement: k6 has been acquired by Grafana Labs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RrDo2wMeV80&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folks at Grafana Labs have been fans of k6 for a while, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been fans (and users) of their work since almost the beginning of k6. While a surprise to many, Grafana and k6 together is a combination that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&#34;https://grafana.com/about/press/2021-06-17-grafana-labs-brings-modern-open-source-load-testing-to-observability-with-acquisition-of-k6/&#34;&gt;Grafana&amp;rsquo;s press release here&lt;/a&gt; to hear more about this milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On this week&amp;rsquo;s Office Hours, &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I were joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/FloorDrees/&#34;&gt;Floor Drees&lt;/a&gt;, the newest member to join the k6 team. Every new person at k6 goes through a week of testing, and Floor decided to spend her week of testing doing an accessibility review on the k6 Cloud web app and documentation. We talk about how accessibiltiy is an often-overlooked form of operational testing, and Floor shares specific tools that testers can use to make applications more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also discuss the k6 open source support program, which makes k6 free for open-source maintainers and regular contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Convergence of Code and Speech</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210609-convergence-of-code-and-speech/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 09 Jun 2021 22:23:19 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210609-convergence-of-code-and-speech/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.womentech.net/en-us/women-tech-conference&#34;&gt;Women Tech Global 2021&lt;/a&gt; conference, I presented a short talk called &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.womentech.net/speaker/Nicole/van%20der%20Hoeven/50129&#34;&gt;Convergence of Code and Speech&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, under the theme of &amp;ldquo;Future of Work&amp;rdquo;. In hindsight, the title was a little pretentious, but what are you going to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten the recording of the live version yet, but I always like to do a recorded test run by myself, and here&amp;rsquo;s what that was like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/sbZ3A8GrDk0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Programming code and human speech are often seen as being positioned at different ends of the spectrum. At one end, code is terse, strictly logical, and limited. On the other end, speech is unbounded and often verbose. However, the gap between the two is narrowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code is moving towards speech. Good code these days is code that exceeds simply being functional; good code is concise, but expressive; good code is easily comprehensible; good code refers to human concepts rather than technical components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shrinking global borders and the internet are making collaborating on code easier than ever before, but contributors may come from different cultures and languages. Remote work has significantly increased the likelihood of a multilingual devleopment team, so code style guides have emerged that are similar to writing style guides. Artificial intelligence is learning to interpret intention, and many apps now employ fuzzy search algorithms. Our expectations for code have increased such that we now expect code to understand us even when we&amp;rsquo;re being imprecise or inaccurate. Modern programming languages like React and Python use hierarchical abstraction to hide complexity, moving towards code that prioritizes being understood over being thorough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other side of the spectrum, speech is also moving towards coding. Multilingual teams also encourage simplicity in written communication, removing colloquialisms and cultural references so that a more global audience can understand us. Tools like Grammarly correct for simplicity and conciseness. Verbal speech, too, is becoming increasingly programmatic with the rise of &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; speakers and personal assistants that enforce a syntax for voice commands. Advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have enabled us to interact with machines in natural language, and machines to interact with us back. OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s GPT-3 can produce convincingly human text about a variety of topics with little prompting. Writing tools like Notion, Roam Research, and Obsidian are growing ecosystems that mix human language with programming keywords to enable backlinks or access other features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the implications of this convergence of code and speech? Writers will need to learn to code, and coders will need to learn to write. The two will become synonymous, and equally essential especially for knowledge workers. Tools that enable both coding and writing will become more valuable, so it&amp;rsquo;s worth investing the time to learn them. Both code and speech have inherent linguistic or cultural biases, so using inclusive language will become even more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are coding and speech converging into? Their intersection is simply expressing thought. She who is able to express thought, both programmatically and naturally, will be best poised to take advantage of this convergence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Making k6 extensions using xk6, with Iván Szkiba and Mihail Stoykov (k6 Office Hours)</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210604-koh-ivan/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on k6 Office Hours, &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I were joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/szkiba&#34;&gt;Iván Szkiba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MStoykov&#34;&gt;Mihail Stoykov&lt;/a&gt; to talk all about extensions. Iván, who is a System Architect at NNG LLC, is the most active k6 extension creator outside of the k6 team. Mihail is a software engineer at k6, and one third of the k6 OSS team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked about the many extensions Iván has created for k6 so that he can incorporate k6 into his team&amp;rsquo;s daily testing activities, his considerations for creating extensions, and how he got started. Mihail also shares some inside information on why certain decisions were made about the way k6 is structured, and common mistakes he sees people make in their custom extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Is Load Testing? - A real-world explanation</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210601-what-is-load-testing/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 20:23:17 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210601-what-is-load-testing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve made about 60 videos on load testing and application performance to date, but I realized that I&amp;rsquo;ve never made one defining load testing, which seemed like a glaring mistake. So, here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cCFwqlcHkX8&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rough transcript below - though I went off script a few times:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing is a key part of making sure that an application performs well and reliably. But what IS load testing, anyway? In this video, I break it down for you in simple terms. And if you&amp;rsquo;re a family member or friend of mine trying to understand what it is I do for a living, thank you! This is for you too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;software-testing&#34;&gt;Software testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a whole team to build software, but some roles are more visible than others. For example, pretend you want to build a bridge. Who do you need to build it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An architect to design the specifications of the bridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A liaison or representative to the gemeente or local council to clarify what the specifications ARE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Builders who will physically build the bridge, who might need to hire subcontractors for various materials and services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone to double-check that what you&amp;rsquo;re building is up to code (testers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone to manage it all, and maybe a few more levels of team leads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic enforcers to detour traffic away from the bridge while it&amp;rsquo;s being built&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who is responsible for &amp;ldquo;building&amp;rdquo; the bridge? The answer is, everybody. Everybody has a part to play. Every part is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the same thing with software. When we think about building software, we often think about developers, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the full picture. Just like building a bridge, it&amp;rsquo;s a team effort. But I want to zoom in on one role in particular, because it&amp;rsquo;s the role I&amp;rsquo;ve had most often: load tester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, let&amp;rsquo;s go on a field trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;load-testing-on-the-field&#34;&gt;Load testing on the field&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this bridge look familar? This is the Sint Servaasbrug, and they SAY that it&amp;rsquo;s the bridge on the €10 note. It might be true, too, because it&amp;rsquo;s here in my current hometown of Maastricht, the Netherlands, where the European Union was founded in the Treaty of Maastricht. The name Maastricht means the crossing of the Maas, which is the name of this river here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s pretend the bridge hasn&amp;rsquo;t been built yet, and that we&amp;rsquo;re helping build it. Let&amp;rsquo;s put on our load tester hats. As a load tester, it&amp;rsquo;s our job to make sure that the bridge can support the weight it is intended to support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we know how much weight it&amp;rsquo;s intended to support? Well, the council or the rest of the team helping us build the bridge might have some ideas on that, or some building standards that we can use. That&amp;rsquo;s a good place to start, and we should definitely discuss that with them, but as a load tester, it&amp;rsquo;s also our job to question those requirements. Let&amp;rsquo;s do some research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the street leading up to the bridge. Remember, the bridge isn&amp;rsquo;t built yet, but maybe we can get an idea of the kind of traffic that the area gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things to watch out for or questions to answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many people are walking?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many are on bikes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many are on bakfiets bikes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are vehicles allowed on this street, and if so, how many of them drive through?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do people tend to pass by in groups, or on their own?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing we can do is check other bridges. This is the Hoogbrug, another bridge across the Maas river. It&amp;rsquo;s not going to be an exact match for the kind of traffic we might expect on OUR bridge, but it might give us some ideas. So we can scout this out the way we did the street near our bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One difference we can see right away is that this bridge has stairs on both ends. Our bridge isn&amp;rsquo;t going to have that. The stairs do have the lip to make pushing a bike up it easier, but it&amp;rsquo;s not as easy as riding through, and any heavier vehicles are out. And people are probably less likely to go up stairs than they are to walk up an incline. So we already know that this bridge will probably experience less traffic than our bridge, but it&amp;rsquo;s still good to take notes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, let&amp;rsquo;s head back home, write down our findings, and think about what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tying-it-back-to-software-testing&#34;&gt;Tying it back to software testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we learned was useful, but there are still a few things we don&amp;rsquo;t know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is 10 AM right now. But is that really the highest point of traffic during the day? To be really sure, we should really try to go back at different times. Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s an increased amount of traffic during lunch as people go to restaurants or back to their homes to eat. Maybe a horde of kids would go across our bridge after school to go home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And we should think beyond that, too. Are weekends busier because more people are out? Or are weekdays busier because people are going to and from work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then there are some things that are seasonal. Maastricht happens to be in the part of the Netherlands that celebrates Carnaval, so sometimes that area looks like &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;. Carnaval involves a slow parade of people, bikes, and trucks through the bridge to the central town square, called the Vrijthof. That&amp;rsquo;s absolutely something we&amp;rsquo;ll have to plan for when testing our bridge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about the bridge this whole time, but as load testers, we go through the same process for software, too. What we&amp;rsquo;ve just done on our field trip is called a workload model. A workload model is describes the load profile for a given test scenario, and it involves determining &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; (the key transactions), &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; (the load distribution among the transactions) and &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; (timing of the load) to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a web application, for example, like a web site, we might try to look through analytics and monitoring tools to try to determine things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many users access our site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which pages do they visit? Some pages are like pedestrians - they don&amp;rsquo;t have much comparative weight and aren&amp;rsquo;t complex to process. But other pages are like big old trucks, that involve many components of our application and are comparatively very intensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When do they visit the site? Is our site the sort of site people go to to work, or to avoid work? at weekends, or during the week?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any seasonal events, like sales or holidays, that might drive MORE people to our site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where are the users from? Are they in the same country that our application servers are located in, or are they quite far away? What sort of internet speeds do they have? What percentage of them use computers to access our site, and what percentage of them use tablets or mobiles?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was just a taste of the kinds of questions a load tester has to answer during the course of testing. There&amp;rsquo;s still a lot more to cover - for starters, we haven&amp;rsquo;t even talked about how to actually RUN the tests yet! I plan to make more videos going through typical activites in load testing in more detail, but for now, I hope that gave you a good idea of what load testing is. And Mom, I hope you know what I do for a living now. :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for watching!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, we had &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/odysseas_lam&#34;&gt;Odysseas Lamtzidis&lt;/a&gt; on the show to talk about &lt;a href=&#34;https://netdata.cloud&#34;&gt;Netdata&lt;/a&gt;, which is an application performance monitoring tool that prides itself on having the easiest setup ever. Odysseas admitted that it might not have all the bells and whistles of other monitoring platforms, it Just Works. I see this as being very interesting especially for testers like me, who just want to have something set up but might not want to be bothered by the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210515-koh-nica/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We were happy to welcome &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/serverlessmom&#34;&gt;Nočnica Fee&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/new_relic&#34;&gt;New Relic&lt;/a&gt; to k6 Office Hours. She very bravely volunteered to learn how to use k6&amp;ndash; live! Talk about pressure. But she handled it like a champ!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also talked about why observability is both particularly important and particularly difficult in serverless architecture. There will definitely be a part two at some point!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We managed to get two other folks from k6 to join our Office Hours: our CEO, Robin Gustafsson, and our Head of Customer Success, Mark Meier. We took advantage of the opportunity to discuss wishlist features for k6 and bug Robin about how likely each feature was to see the light of day!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten the feedback that people would like to see more videos of the basics of using k6 and k6 Cloud, so here&amp;rsquo;s a video on getting situated with the k6 Cloud interface and navigation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning more about chaos engineering. In this week&amp;rsquo;s k6 Office Hours, I shared my experience as a tester getting started with Kubernetes, chaos engineering with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/simskij/xk6-chaos&#34;&gt;xk6-chaos&lt;/a&gt; and k6, and observability with &lt;a href=&#34;https://newrelic.com&#34;&gt;New Relic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between performance testing vs. load testing? This week, Simme and I were joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.srperf.com/&#34;&gt;Señor Performo&lt;/a&gt;, aka Leandro Melendez, and Pepe Cano, the Head of Marketing at k6, to talk about this common question.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I attended the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cambridge.org/&#34;&gt;Cambridge University Press&lt;/a&gt; QA Week 2021 to talk about load testing with k6. Here&amp;rsquo;s a recording of the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a travel video from January 2020, when my husband Rob and I did a roadtrip in Scotland with our good friends, Nikki and Basti Filler. This is towards the tail end of that trip, and it involved some of the best scenery I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. Scotland is a gorgeous country that we thoroughly enjoyed exploring, despite its awful weather. As a bonus, this was also our first trip with our new niece, Cassie.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210211-503-podcast/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This must be the month for trying new things, because I jumped into livestreaming with the first ever &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210205-k6-office-hours&#34;&gt;k6 Office Hours&lt;/a&gt; just a week ago, and this week I&amp;rsquo;m jumping into podcasting with &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme Aronsson&lt;/a&gt;, who&amp;rsquo;s also doing the Office Hours with me. There&amp;rsquo;s definitely safety (at least psychological safety) in numbers, because doing it with someone else makes me feel a little more brave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the podcast is presented by &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io&#34;&gt;k6&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;rsquo;s really just a fancy term for saying that we&amp;rsquo;re both employed by k6 and we&amp;rsquo;re recording and producing the podcast on company time. Unlike the Office Hours, which is heavily k6-focused, the podcast will be about software performance and reliability in general. Simme and I happen to have different and complementary skillsets (he comes from a developer background, and I come from a testing background, and I think that makes for an interesting combination of perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the first episode! It should also be available on your audio podcasting tool of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The first ever k6 Office Hours</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210205-k6-office-hours/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The k6 virtual office is open!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I heard about office hours was from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.notion.so/&#34;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; went in on this trend as well. The concept involves opening your virtual doors regularly to your community, to answer questions and share best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big part of being a Developer Advocate is talking &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; people, and even conferences these days are mostly pre-recorded. I kind of miss being able to interact &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; people. I miss the immediacy of &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt;. So I talked &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme Aronsson&lt;/a&gt; into doing a k6 Office Hours with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re both new to livestreaming, so there&amp;rsquo;s a lot that we&amp;rsquo;ve learned and will be improving in future videos, but here&amp;rsquo;s our first attempt!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcYeboT5FYE&amp;amp;list=PLJdv3RhAQXNHsC8OOV3ZjwZvC9tRoAYF2&#34;&gt;joined the k6 team in late November&lt;/a&gt;, the foremost question on my mind was &amp;ldquo;How does this compare to JMeter?&amp;rdquo; You see, I come from a performance testing consulting background, and in the last few years, JMeter has been far and away my tool of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what am I doing on the k6 site, talking about how much I love JMeter? Well, firstly, it turns out that the k6 team is pretty open and transparent, especially about potential improvements in k6. Secondly, I want to share my reasons for wanting to explore k6 as a load testing tool&amp;ndash; the same reasons that ultimately convinced me to join the team that builds it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-jmeter&#34;&gt;What is JMeter?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org/&#34;&gt;JMeter&lt;/a&gt; is an open source load testing tool built entirely in Java by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Apache Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. It was first released in 1998, and it made waves because of its audacity in taking on more popular but proprietary load testing tools. JMeter took what other companies were charging a lot of money for and published it online for everyone to use&amp;ndash; for free. Although scripts can also be extended using code, majority of the scripting in JMeter is done using the UI. At the time of this writing, the latest version of JMeter is 5.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-k6&#34;&gt;What is k6?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/loadimpact/k6&#34;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; load testing tool released by &lt;a href=&#34;https://loadimpact.com&#34;&gt;LoadImpact&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. LoadImpact had previously consisted of the SaaS platform (now &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/cloud&#34;&gt;k6 Cloud&lt;/a&gt;) and professional services. k6 is written in Go, but scripts are written in Javascript. Taking the opposite tack to JMeter, k6&amp;rsquo;s main selling point is its code-based scripting and heavy prioritization of the developer experience. The latest version of k6 is 0.30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;which-is-better&#34;&gt;Which is better?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article isn&amp;rsquo;t about which tool is &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;, because as much as we might prefer a clear-cut answer, there&amp;rsquo;s no &amp;ldquo;best tool&amp;rdquo;. Everything depends on the situation your team is in: what, how, why, and when you&amp;rsquo;re testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question that I want to answer here is: &lt;em&gt;What situations does each tool excel in?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;when-does-jmeter-excel&#34;&gt;When does JMeter excel?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-you-want-to-get-started-quickly&#34;&gt;When you want to get started quickly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jmeter-has-a-gui&#34;&gt;JMeter has a GUI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many testing teams make decisions on load testing tools based on this fact alone. Sometimes, if you&amp;rsquo;re in a situation where people haven&amp;rsquo;t done load testing before and need to learn a new tool, a GUI-driven tool like JMeter is simply the most frictionless option. A tool with a GUI will be less daunting for many testers that are used to the mostly no-code UIs of the likes of Postman or SOAPUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/01-jmetergui.png&#34; alt=&#34;JMeter&amp;amp;rsquo;s starting screen: a fresh new test plan&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought of JMeter as user-friendly, but a developer friend recently pointed out that the Test Plan screen that greets you when you first start JMeter doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide any indication of how to create an HTTP sampler. None of the icons add elements to the test plan. It takes a bit of exploring to realize that right clicking on the test plan, or going to Edit &amp;gt; Add, will show the &amp;ldquo;Add&amp;rdquo; menu that you need. He has a point there: UI is subjective to a certain degree. However, I&amp;rsquo;d argue that it&amp;rsquo;s definitely easier for non-developers to explore a UI than a bit of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a GUI packaged within the tool, but the &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/test-authoring/test-builder&#34;&gt;k6 Test Builder&lt;/a&gt; is available for free. It&amp;rsquo;s a way to create tests with a GUI interface, and despite its inclusion in k6 cloud, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any subscription to use. However, it isn&amp;rsquo;t as fully-featured as JMeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jmeter-supports-many-protocols-and-features-out-of-the-box&#34;&gt;JMeter supports many protocols and features out of the box&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org/index.html&#34;&gt;the official list&lt;/a&gt; of the protocols that JMeter supports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web - HTTP, HTTPS (Java, NodeJS, PHP, ASP.NET, …)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SOAP / REST Webservices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FTP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database via JDBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LDAP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Message-oriented middleware (MOM) via JMS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mail - SMTP(S), POP3(S) and IMAP(S)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Native commands or shell scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TCP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java Objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, k6 supports the following protocols:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web - HTTP/1.1, &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/protocols/http-2&#34;&gt;HTTP/2&lt;/a&gt; (Java, NodeJS, PHP, ASP.NET, …)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/protocols/websockets&#34;&gt;WebSockets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/protocols/grpc&#34;&gt;gRPC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SOAP / REST Webservices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protocols above are those that are natively supported. However, both tools allow the development of third-party plugins, adding support for more protocols. The number of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/topics/xk6&#34;&gt;k6 community extensions&lt;/a&gt;, through &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/blog/extending-k6-with-xk6&#34;&gt;xk6&lt;/a&gt;, is growing, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter-plugins.org/&#34;&gt;JMeter plugins&lt;/a&gt; still outnumber them. In many cases, the protocols your application uses may make the decision for you of which tool to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMeter also has most of the features you&amp;rsquo;ll need for a basic load test, and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to code any of it up yourself. Its parent-child element structure means that you can modify a specific element, like an HTTP request, or modify all HTTP requests, with equal ease. Adding think time to all requests is as easy as adding a Uniform Random Timer to your thread group, and all requests within that group will inherit it.
With code-based load testing tools, it can be a bit more difficult to find out what&amp;rsquo;s possible without a UI. Some of the gap, however, can be bridged by an IDE with good autocompletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-you-want-a-mature-community-with-tons-of-documentation&#34;&gt;When you want a mature community with tons of documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMeter&amp;rsquo;s old, and sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing. It&amp;rsquo;s been around since 1998, so at this point, it&amp;rsquo;s had 22 years to improve and to build a following. JMeter has a presence on nearly every community networking site, and no matter how specific your use case for JMeter is, the chances are that it&amp;rsquo;s been done before. Searching &amp;ldquo;how to load test X with JMeter&amp;rdquo; is bound to yield thousands of hits and some videos showing you exactly how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMeter&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html&#34;&gt;Component Reference&lt;/a&gt; is proof of JMeter&amp;rsquo;s extensive and thorough documentation. Every element, function, and property is discussed in more detail than most people could ever want, and that&amp;rsquo;s just the &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; documentation that&amp;rsquo;s on the Apache site. There are thousands of JMeter books, tutorials, and courses by its passionate users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apache/jmeter&#34;&gt;JMeter GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; has 17,290 commits as of December 2020 - evidence of a community of developers that have committed some time and experience to JMeter over the last two decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison, the k6 community is growing, but still small. There is an official and &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.k6.io/&#34;&gt;central community forum&lt;/a&gt; that allows users to share their experiences with k6, which is something missing from the JMeter community. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/loadimpact/k6&#34;&gt;k6 repository&lt;/a&gt; does have more stars, but significantly fewer commits at 3,795. Much of the disparity, of course, is because k6 is very new - the open-source tool k6 was only released in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-you-need-a-cost-effective-way-to-do-distributed-load-testing&#34;&gt;When you need a cost-effective way to do distributed load testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of JMeter&amp;rsquo;s absolute best features is that it gives you a framework for running distributed load tests with it. This is pretty special for a free and open-source tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distributed testing means ramping up the amount of load you&amp;rsquo;re generating with your load tests, usually by increasing the number of virtual users and running multiple instances of your script on other load generators. JMeter accomplishes this by designating a controller node and letting you set up worker nodes. Each worker node needs to have a copy of &lt;code&gt;jmeter-server&lt;/code&gt;, a utility included with every JMeter installation (in &lt;code&gt;jmeter/bin&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/02-jmeterdistributed.svg&#34; alt=&#34;JMeter comes with a native distributed testing mode&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/jmeter_distributed_testing_step_by_step.html&#34;&gt;Apache JMeter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These worker nodes then run copies of your test plan and exert load against your application server. You can use on-premise or cloud machines as your worker nodes. A distributed execution like this takes a bit to set up, but it does work surprisingly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a &lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; distributed load testing mode. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; containerize it yourself and deploy it via Kubernetes, for instance, but it does require a more involved setup. The team is also working on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/k6io/operator&#34;&gt;k6 Operator&lt;/a&gt;, which makes setup significantly easier, but it is experimental and comes with drawbacks such as not supporting threshold synchronization between instances. For now, the easiest way to scale up on k6 is by using the paid service k6 Cloud, which reduces setup time and complexity significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that JMeter can be quite resource-hungry, and thus is more likely to require multiple load generators to generate load than k6. Depending on the resources of the load generator, JMeter can run about a thousand virtual users on average, and scaling up your test beyond that point will require a distributed execution setup. A single instance of k6, on the other hand, can run tens of thousands of virtual users given the same resources. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-you-want-canned-reports-built-into-your-load-testing-tool&#34;&gt;When you want canned reports built into your load testing tool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMeter&amp;rsquo;s many listeners allow you to decide exactly what format you want to view results in. Debugging? Use the View Results Tree. Wanting metrics for your load test? Use the Summary or Aggregate Report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/03-jmeterlistener.png&#34; alt=&#34;Adding listeners like View Results Tree in JMeter lets you visualize results in different ways&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, JMeter can generate HTML reports based on your load tests. They&amp;rsquo;re currently quite limited, but functional, and they have several default graphs to help you analyze your load test. They are not interactive, but they are pretty easy to generate and a good starting point for putting together a report template for your tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/04-jmeterhtmlreport.png&#34; alt=&#34;JMeter&amp;amp;rsquo;s built-in HTML dashboard is limited but functional&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 does not have built-in reporting. Its modular nature lends itself better to integrating with &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/results-visualization&#34;&gt;many other data analytics tools&lt;/a&gt;, including Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, Amazon CloudWatch, and k6 Cloud&amp;ndash; all of which are better analysis tools and can provide more insights than what JMeter&amp;rsquo;s reports can provide, but they do require you to set up another tool to analyze your tests. If you&amp;rsquo;re running low on time and can make do with its reports, JMeter does really well at providing that extra value out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;when-does-k6-excel&#34;&gt;When does k6 excel?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-you-want-to-get-started-quickly-1&#34;&gt;When you want to get started quickly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup, I put this one in both the JMeter and k6 sections. JMeter and k6 can each be easy to get started with, but for very different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;installation&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 installs extremely quickly - on my first installation of it on macOS, it took &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5tteMKZUqk&amp;amp;t=99&#34;&gt;7 seconds&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;code&gt;brew install k6&lt;/code&gt;. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t require nodeJS or any other dependencies, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMeter itself is fairly easy to install, but before you install JMeter, you need to install Java. Especially if you&amp;rsquo;re using Windows, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a rite of passage for a new JMeter user to run into issues adding the environment variables needed for Java to function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be confusing to determine which version of Java is the right one. There&amp;rsquo;s JDK, JRE, and recently Oracle has added to the confusion by announcing that some versions of Java (but not all) are going to require a license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/05-javalicense.png&#34; alt=&#34;Oracle&amp;amp;rsquo;s changing Java licensing can cause confusion for JMeter users&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://java.com/en/download/&#34;&gt;Oracle Java&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While JMeter is still free via OpenJDK, I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to a few testers who mistakenly thought they&amp;rsquo;d have to pay for JMeter. It&amp;rsquo;s a little disconcerting to see Oracle flexing its muscles here, especially if you&amp;rsquo;ve built a whole performance testing suite on Java through JMeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;plugins&#34;&gt;Plugins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/blog/extending-k6-with-xk6&#34;&gt;supports plugins&lt;/a&gt;, but they&amp;rsquo;re not necessary. For most use cases, k6&amp;rsquo;s built-in functionality should be more than sufficient. This is in sharp contrast to JMeter, where everything is a plugin &amp;hellip; even the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/PluginsManager/&#34;&gt;Plugin Manager&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most JMeter users would argue that there is a standard set of plugins that you should download before you even begin to use it. A new JMeter user might not necessarily know where to find these and may have a less-than-satisfying experience out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things you &lt;em&gt;won&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; have if you stick to a vanilla, no-plugin JMeter installation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thread groups: No custom load profile, stages, rendezvous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controllers: No parallel controller to execute requests in parallel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Samplers: No HTTP/2 support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test Data: No randomization of lines within a CSV file (sequential only)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timers: No throughput shaping timer for setting throughput in stages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These functions are all available within k6 from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scripting&#34;&gt;Scripting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 scripts are written in javascript, making them simple to write and run. All you need is one installer (on Microsoft Windows) or a single command on your terminal and any text editor. For JMeter, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to install a few things locally before you can get started: Java, JMeter itself, and the standard set of plugins you&amp;rsquo;ll need. This can be confusing for new users. Who hasn&amp;rsquo;t struggled with environment variables at some point when learning to use JMeter, especially on Windows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also takes time to learn any new UI, whereas javascript is near-ubiquitous and it&amp;rsquo;s a good language to learn when you&amp;rsquo;re load testing web sites anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-you-want-to-maximize-performance-and-efficiency&#34;&gt;When you want to maximize performance and efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;test-your-test-tools&#34;&gt;Test your test tools!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does all this matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we&amp;rsquo;re talking about simulating many virtual users, slow performance = high cost. There is a cost to the number of load generators you use, whether it&amp;rsquo;s the cost to acquire and maintain them (on-prem) or the cost of a cloud service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes sense to consider the performance limitations of your load testing tool before you use it to improve your own application&amp;rsquo;s performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;k6-builds-on-gos-stellar-performance&#34;&gt;k6 builds on Go&amp;rsquo;s stellar performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 is written in Go, and Go is built with performance in mind. &amp;ldquo;Go is a compiled language and does not need to be interpreted, unlike Java or Python. There is no added layer of complexity.&amp;rdquo; It also has no external dependencies, which is a good thing. Fewer moving parts for a performance tester means fewer potential sources of a bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest and most common way for a load testing tool to run a virtual user is to assign one virtual user to one kernel or OS thread. However, the 1 Thread: 1 Virtual User paradigm has a serious flaw: when a virtual user is waiting for a response or executing a programmed &lt;code&gt;sleep()&lt;/code&gt;, the thread is also blocked, and cannot process other work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In k6, each virtual user is run on a goroutine, not a thread. What difference does that make? Well, goroutines can be controlled by something called the Go Scheduler, which acts like a traffic cop. It reuses idle threads and intelligently assigns work, by allowing &amp;ldquo;work stealing&amp;rdquo; and work hand-offs between threads. Does this sound familiar? This is the same principle that load balancers are built on: An external monitor that oversees the flow of work improves general performance. Go itself is intrinsically load-balanced in a way that many programming languages aren&amp;rsquo;t, which makes it the perfect foundation for a load testing tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to leverage Go&amp;rsquo;s innate performance optimizations also translates into significantly less memory utilization. One thread running k6 doesn&amp;rsquo;t go above 100 kb, whereas a JVM thread like JMeter uses, for instance, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baeldung.com/jvm-configure-stack-sizes&#34;&gt;uses the default of 1MB&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s 1000% more than k6! Of course, Java allows a user to tweak an app&amp;rsquo;s memory utilization, so the difference is usually not quite as stark, but it&amp;rsquo;s still interesting to note that Go has a much lower starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; creating [a] new thread in Java is not memory efficient. As every thread consumes approx 1MB of the memory heap size and eventually if you start spinning thousands of threads, they will put tremendous pressure on the heap and will cause shut down due to out of memory. Also, if you want to communicate between two or more threads, it’s very difficult. - &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@kevalpatel2106/why-should-you-learn-go-f607681fad65&#34;&gt;Keval Patel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;performance-benefits-in-practice&#34;&gt;Performance benefits in practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fewer load generators needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6&amp;rsquo;s comparatively better performance means it needs fewer load generators to execute a given amount of load. Rafaela Azevedo made a comparison of the memory used by k6 and JMeter, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://azevedorafaela.com/2020/07/06/load-tests-jmeter-vs-k6/&#34;&gt;here are her results&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMeter took up 760 MB of memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, k6 took up 256 MB of memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;k6&amp;rsquo;s lower memory footprint is the reason it can run more virtual users and generate more load than average. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re using load generators that are on-premise or in a cloud, you&amp;rsquo;ll pay less for provisioning costs when using k6. This cost saving makes k6 a great tool for budget-conscious teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common misconception of many load testers is that distributed execution (ability to launch a load test on multiple machines) is required to generate large load. This is not the case with k6. - &lt;a href=&#34;https://azevedorafaela.com/2020/07/06/load-tests-jmeter-vs-k6/&#34;&gt;Rafaela Azevedo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 is different from many other load testing tools in the way it handles hardware resources. A single k6 process will efficiently use all CPU cores on a load generator machine. A single instance of k6 is often enough to generate load of 30.000-40.000 simultaneous users (VUs). This amount of VUs can generate upwards of 300,000 requests per second (RPS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you need more than 100,000-300,000 requests per second (6-12M requests per minute), a single instance of k6 will likely be sufficient for your needs. - &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/testing-guides/running-large-tests&#34;&gt;k6 documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No out of memory errors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 is also good for when you&amp;rsquo;re short on time. Using JMeter means getting familiar with how to performance tune Java and how to fix the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eginnovations.com/blog/top-10-java-performance-problems/&#34;&gt;most common Java performance problems&lt;/a&gt;, because there are several. The one that I&amp;rsquo;ve personally run into the most while using JMeter is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;ERROR - jmeter.threads.JMeterThread: Test failed! java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Java heap space. 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re not really a JMeter load tester until you&amp;rsquo;ve seen this error. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause for this error is usually that there was an insufficient amount of Heap memory allocated to JMeter. Yup&amp;ndash; in addition to monitoring your load generator&amp;rsquo;s memory usage, you&amp;rsquo;ll also need to monitor the JVM&amp;rsquo;s memory usage. You can set the amount of heap memory allocated to JMeter by modifying the JMeter binary itself and changing this line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; This is the base heap size &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; you may increase or decrease it to fit your
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; system&lt;span style=&#34;color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;s memory availability&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;${HEAP:=&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;Xms1g &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;Xmx1g &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;XX&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;MaxMetaspaceSize&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;256m&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even JMeter official documentation suggests that you increase the Java Heap size beyond 1GB before you even run your first load test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increase the Java Heap size. By default JMeter runs with a heap of 1 GB, this might not be enough for your test and depends on your test plan and number of threads you want to run - &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html&#34;&gt;Apache JMeter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No GUI means no resource overhead during load tests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GUIs typically add significantly more overhead to an application, which is one of the reasons why k6 doesn&amp;rsquo;t have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re running a load test, the best practice is to run it from the command line anyway&amp;ndash; because otherwise, it interferes with your results. Code-based load testing tools are performant from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMeter is peppered with warnings about the GUI&amp;rsquo;s effect on performance. Here&amp;rsquo;s one from the &amp;ldquo;JMeter documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t run load test using GUI mode ! - &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html&#34;&gt;Apache JMeter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s a message that occurs upon startup of JMeter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/09-jmeterguimodewarning.png&#34; alt=&#34;JMeter&amp;amp;rsquo;s startup screen warns users not to use the GUI mode for load testing&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not having a GUI means there&amp;rsquo;s one less gotcha. Any load testing scripts you create in k6 are ready for prime-time execution whenever you&amp;rsquo;re ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-you-want-to-do-goal-oriented-testing&#34;&gt;When you want to do goal-oriented testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important question a load tester can ask when starting a new load testing project is &amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rdquo;?
Test plans should be made to directly address a team&amp;rsquo;s reasons for wanting to do load testing, and that should be reflected in the non-functional requirements. Non-functional requirements, in turn, should then give some guidance as to the bounds of acceptable performance. A common example for these bounds, or thresholds, is an average response time of less than 3 seconds for all transactions during the test.
k6 does this natively with &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/thresholds&#34;&gt;global thresholds&lt;/a&gt; worked into the script, and you can also create your own metric to use in a threshold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;k6/http&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Rate&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;k6/metrics&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;myFailRate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Rate&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;failed requests&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; {

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  },
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;};
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; () {

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/thresholds&#34;&gt;k6 documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMeter doesn&amp;rsquo;t natively support thresholds at the test-level. There are a few ways that I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to work around this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration Assertion&lt;/strong&gt;: You can add a Duration Assertion to any sampler in JMeter, which allows you set an acceptable response time for that request in milliseconds, beyond which the request (and the transaction that encompasses it) would be marked as failed. However, this is still just at the individual request level, and even putting the duration assertion element at the Test Plan level only applies the same threshold to each child request. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t constitute pass/fail criteria for the test as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timers&lt;/strong&gt;: For criteria related to throughput, you can use the Constant Throughput Timer or the Throughput Shaping Timer (plugin). This approach controls how many requests per second are spent. In my experience, it&amp;rsquo;s worth testing how these timers behave when using nested transaction controllers - it may take some rearranging to get right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance Plugin&lt;/strong&gt;: When integrating JMeter with Jenkins, you can use the Performance Plugin to set error thresholds and mark test runs (&amp;ldquo;builds&amp;rdquo;) as unstable or failed within Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom Code&lt;/strong&gt;: You can use the JSR223 Sampler to write a bit of Groovy or BeanShell code that collects and parses response metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that even though these options make setting thresholds possible in JMeter, they&amp;rsquo;re still workarounds that don&amp;rsquo;t come with JMeter out of the box or don&amp;rsquo;t adequately address the creation of different types of thresholds (error, response time, throughput, CPU, memory). What I end up doing, more often than not, is exporting the raw data from JMeter and doing the analysis myself using another tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-youre-part-of-a-team-of-scripters&#34;&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re part of a team of scripters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 shines in situations where more than one person could be doing the scripting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-strikes-a-middle-ground-that-developers-and-testers-can-compromise-on&#34;&gt;It strikes a middle ground that developers and testers can compromise on&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software quality should not be the sole responsibility of testers; quality should be baked into every activity when building software. One of the challenges in implementing this concept, however, is that there has traditionally been a segmentation in tools and languages used by team members with different functions. Developers use one tool; testers use another. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to encourage developers to test and testers to code in this environment, and many testing tools only further encourage this divide. A developer can&amp;rsquo;t use a tool like JMeter for anything but testing, so the incentive to invest the effort in learning it is lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 bridges the gap by bringing testing concepts and features to an environment and language that developers are already spending their time in. Javascript is useful for more than just writing load testing scripts, and k6 works well with any IDE or text editor. A frictionless developer experience is central to the k6 philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;its-easier-to-collaborate-on-scripts&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easier to collaborate on scripts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve convinced both devs and testers to contribute to load testing scripts, how do you keep track of changes? How do you manage scripts that multiple people are working on at the same time?
With tests as code, the easiest way is to just use versioning tools like Git, the way you probably are already using for your application code. Again, no new framework or processes to learn here.
k6&amp;rsquo;s conciseness and portability really proves to be an advantage in collaboration situations. To illustrate this, let&amp;rsquo;s consider a simple test script that contains a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A GET request to &lt;a href=&#34;https://test.k6.io&#34;&gt;our test site&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;code&gt;https://test.k6.io&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A transaction that calls this request &lt;code&gt;01_Home&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A check to fail non-HTTP 200 responses or responses that don&amp;rsquo;t have the text &lt;code&gt;Collection of simple web-pages suitable for load testing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variable think time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll just run that as a single user, for a single iteration. Here&amp;rsquo;s what that script looks like in k6:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;k6/http&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;check&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;k6&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;https://test.k6.io&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, {&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;01_Home&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; }});

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;          &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;stringProp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;ConstantTimer.delay&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;1000&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/stringProp&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;          &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;stringProp&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;RandomTimer.range&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;4000&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/stringProp&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/UniformRandomTimer&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;hashTree/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/hashTree&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/hashTree&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/hashTree&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/jmeterTestPlan&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which one is easier to understand? If you had to modify the script to add a request, which format would you choose to do it in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripting in XML makes merge conflicts more likely and breaking changes in automation pipelines way more difficult to pinpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve collaborated with others on JMeter scripts in the past, and we always opened up scripts in the GUI. It&amp;rsquo;s way easier to spot changes there - but that also created some new issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-you-want-something-easy-to-maintain&#34;&gt;When you want something easy to maintain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;versioning-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;Versioning for load testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When ramping up load tests to more than one load generator, keeping track of the versions of necessary components ensures that one load generator&amp;rsquo;s traffic is the same as another&amp;rsquo;s. The value of reducing variables in scientific experiments holds true for load testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With k6, you just need to worry about the version of k6 and the script. No other dependencies are required. If you&amp;rsquo;re using plugins, you&amp;rsquo;d need to track those too, but as mentioned previously, plugins in k6 aren&amp;rsquo;t as necessary as they are in some other tools &amp;ndash; and k6 is available as a Docker image to reduce those issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With something like JMeter, there are more levels to consider. There&amp;rsquo;s the version of JMeter itself, Java, versions of plugins, and then the script. Every new layer introduces more changes for incompatibilities. In previous projets I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on, someone would inevitably try out a new plugin and forget to discuss it with the team, and anyone who tried to open that script in their copy of JMeter would see this error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/10-jmeterpluginerror.png&#34; alt=&#34;This is the error that JMeter throws when you attempt to open a test plan that includes a plugin you don&amp;amp;rsquo;t have installed locally&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error means there&amp;rsquo;s a plugin that the script uses that JMeter doesn&amp;rsquo;t recognize, but depending on the plugin, it&amp;rsquo;s not always this easy to pinpoint which one (it was the &lt;code&gt;Ultimate Thread Group&lt;/code&gt; in this case).
You don&amp;rsquo;t want that happening in the middle of your load test because you forgot to add a plugin to some of your load generators!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;its-easier-to-link-test-code-with-application-code&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easier to link test code with application code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your application code is in Javascript, k6 is a shoo-in as a load testing tool. You could build tests that are tightly integrated with application code by importing objects and having your tests interacting with them directly. This approach would reduce a lot of time spent in refactoring test scripts when objects are changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re already using VS Code, k6 even has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=k6.k6&#34;&gt;VS Code plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;test-as-code-gives-you-control&#34;&gt;Test as code gives you control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having your scripts be pure code reduces ambiguities in that you&amp;rsquo;re not limited by poor UI design or bugs in third-party plugins. k6 scripts are Typescript-typed, so most IDEs support autocompletion while you&amp;rsquo;re scripting - the code equivalent of helpful tooltips, except way more universal.
k6 scripts give you the freedom to import and use JS libraries, so you can build on code others have already written. While k6 is not NodeJS, there are even &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/modules#bundling-node-modules&#34;&gt;some NodeJS packages&lt;/a&gt; that you can bundle for use with your scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;no-external-dependencies&#34;&gt;No external dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 doesn&amp;rsquo;t require NodeJS or anything else to run, which also reduces the likelihood of bugs that might affect your scripts. For example, since JMeter runs on Java, it is also dependent on Java. When Java receives a new version, that often requires a JMeter update as well. JMeter versions understandably lag a bit behind Java versions as developers refactor code, but this gap can lead to potential security issues in a previous version of Java that may remain unpatched in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With k6, development can proceed independently of any third-party component, so major issues can be addressed more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Supports fewer, modern protocols natively (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, WebSockets, gRPC)&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best advice, when attempting to choose a load testing tool, is to do a proof of concept with the most promising candidates. Some features or bugs may prove more or less important when used in an actual testing cycle. However, don&amp;rsquo;t put too much weight on comparisons of the load test &lt;em&gt;results&lt;/em&gt; from two different tools - each tool records metrics differently, and it&amp;rsquo;s more meaningful to compare results against previous runs with the same tool. When switching tools, reestablish a baseline in the new tool each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary that might help you decide between JMeter and k6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;both-tools-do-well-at&#34;&gt;Both tools do well at:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generating protocol-level load on an application server by scripting complex user flows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realistic scripting with the use of dynamic think time, test data generation and reuse, and customizable workload models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation of features and consistency of releases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;neither-tool-supports&#34;&gt;Neither tool supports:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generating browser-level load and interacting with DOM elements, especially for SPA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detailed results analysis (JMeter has pre-generated HTML reports and listeners, but they are far from ideal). Users should expect to integrate results with databases and data visualization software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jmeter-is-best-for&#34;&gt;JMeter is best for:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;traditional testing teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those looking for a GUI-driven testing tool with tons of third-party tutorials and extensive protocol support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;previous users of commercial tools like LoadRunner and NeoLoad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;k6-is-best-for&#34;&gt;k6 is best for:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collaborative, cross-functional engineering teams where testing spans acrosss multiple roles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those looking for a simple and lightweight, yet fully-featured load testing tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;teams looking to integrate testing into existing development workflows and CI/CD pipelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing scripting tools are by no means the most important consideration for the success of load testing. Knowing &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;rsquo;re testing, what the requirements are, and understanding and communicating results are all arguably more important. The right tool will enable you to address those concerns while providing as little friction as possible. There&amp;rsquo;s no unequivocal &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; tool; there&amp;rsquo;s only the right tool for &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; project and context.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week of Testing Wrap-up: My thoughts on k6 as a load testing tool</title>

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20201217-week-of-testing-07/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to make a final wrap-up video for my &amp;ldquo;Week of Testing&amp;rdquo; with k6&amp;hellip; ok, so it&amp;rsquo;s actually three weeks later now, but I wanted to explore k6 a little bit more before I gave my opinion on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s the audio version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, k6, for being awesome enough to agree to this video series before knowing what I&amp;rsquo;d say. Gotta love a company that welcomes transparency and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cuándo JMeter no alcanza: Pruebas de carga simulando navegadores</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20201216-cuando-jmeter-no-alcanza/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aquí está el video de mi presentación en JMeter Scripting Day, un evento organizado por &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeterenespanol.org/&#34;&gt;JMeter en Español&lt;/a&gt; el 31 de Oktubre, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Y la versión audio:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/1f17kzrbYmOxk8e65JBTQH&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;232&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introducción&#34;&gt;Introducción&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hola a todos! Yo soy Nicole van der Hoeven, y soy performance tester. JMeter es una de mis herramientas favoritas porque es gratis, simple, y por muchos casos hace exactamente lo que quiero y no más. Sin embargo, como performers es parte de nuestro trabajo elegir la herramienta adecuada para cada proyecto, y hay que admitir que hay situaciones en que JMeter simplemente no es suficiente.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;amazon---ui--dev-tools&#34;&gt;Amazon - UI + Dev Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esto es el sitio web de Amazon.com. Tengo abierta la pantalla de Chrome Developer Tools, que me muestra las solicitudes (o requests) que componen la página. Cuándo vamos a la página, el navegador (Chrome en este caso) envia estas solicitudes para nosotros, pero eso occure en el fondo. Un usuario normal no las ve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jmeter---creando-un-script&#34;&gt;JMeter - Creando un script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo que JMeter hace es grabar estas solicitudes y replicarlas. Aqui vemos una ejecución de un usuario virtual de un script en JMeter. Cada solicitud tiene la respuesta y el tiempo de respuesta. Pero eso no nos da una idea completa del rendimiento de la aplicación. ¿Por qué?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por que JMeter, como otras herramientas de nivel protocolo, tiene unas limitaciónes. La primera es que si hay javascript o otros script que deben estar ejecutado por el navegador, JMeter no los ejecuta. JMeter solo los descarga. El tiempo de respuesta mide la descarga, no la duración de la ejecución. Entonces, siempre habrá una diferencia entre los tiempos de respuesta en una prueba de JMeter y los tiempos de respuesta en práctica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A veces esta diferencia no es tan importante. Pero hay más y más aplicaciones hoy en día que se componen principalmente de estos javascript. Por esas aplicaciones, simplemente no es posible hacer un script en JMeter porque la mayoría de la lógica de la aplicación occure en el navegador, no en el servidor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;flood-challenge&#34;&gt;Flood Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La segunda razón es que el aumento de la seguridad de aplicaciones conduce a solicitudes más complejas que incluyen parámetros dinámicos. Estos parámetros hacen que sea más difícil para un intermediario lanzar un ataque, pero también hacen que sea más difícil para nosotros scripters, porque tenemos que extraer información desde la última respuesta y ponerla en la próxima solicitud. Es posible, pero es la pesadilla de cada performance tester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podemos verlo en la aplicación de muestra &lt;a href=&#34;https://challenge.flood.io&#34;&gt;Flood Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. Ya no trabajo para Flood, pero todavía es un buen ejemplo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;correlación-en-jmeter---flood-challenge-script&#34;&gt;Correlación en JMeter - Flood challenge script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esto es mi script en JMeter, y vemos que hay muchos parámetros que he tenido que correlacionar. La solicitud para simular hacer clic en el botón &amp;ldquo;Start&amp;rdquo; necesita los parámetros authenticity token, step ID, y step number, que son dinámicos. El contenido de los parámetros cambian cada vez que usamos esta aplicación.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;la-experiencia-del-usuario&#34;&gt;La experiencia del usuario&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La tercera razón es que JMeter tampoco mide la verdadera experiencia del usuario. Solo mide la duración de la comunicación entre el navegador y el servidor, pero no mide cosas como la representación de elementos en la página web, ni el efecto de un script que dura mucho tiempo para terminar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eso es importante porque estas cosas afectan significativamente la experiencia del usuario. De hecho, Steve Souders, un conocido el la industría de performance, dice que &lt;a href=&#34;https://rigor.com/blog/80-90-of-load-times-are-spent-on-the-front-end-start-there/#:~:text=Start%20there.,-Written%20by%20Craig&amp;amp;text=Last%20month%2C%20Steve%20Souders%2C%20Google&#39;s,is%20spent%20on%20the%20frontend&#34;&gt;hasta 90% del tiempo de respuesta&lt;/a&gt; que experimenta el usuario está en la interfaz. Con este numero podemos estar ciertos que una prueba con una herramienta de nivel protocolo no va a poder encapsular el rendimiento final de una aplicación.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;developer-tools---lighthouse&#34;&gt;Developer Tools - Lighthouse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entonces, ¿qué podemos hacer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo más fácil es intentar de medir la interfaz durante una prueba de cargas. Mientras ejecutamos una prueba con JMeter, podemos ir manualmente a la aplicación web en Chrome para usar Developer Tools. Podemos usar la pestaña Lighthouse, que nos da más métricos del perspectivo del usuario y sugerencias para mejorar el rendimiento.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;webpagetest&#34;&gt;WebPageTest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;También uso &lt;a href=&#34;https://webpagetest.org&#34;&gt;WebPageTest&lt;/a&gt; a veces. Eso tiene más opciones para ejecutar la prueba automáticamente varias veces desde un lugar que puedo elegir. Aún podemos elegir un dispositivo para simular la experiencia de un usuario en un iPad, por ejemplo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;herramientas-alternativas-para-pruebas-de-carga&#34;&gt;Herramientas alternativas para pruebas de carga&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tambien podemos elegir herramientas alternativas para ejecutar nuestras pruebas de carga. Lo que tienen en común es que fueron diseñadas para pruebas de automatización, y utilizan un navegador real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.selenium.dev/&#34;&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt; es probablemente la más popular de esas. Selenium WebDriver en particular. Es compatible con Ruby, Java, Python, C# y Javascript. El problema con Selenium es que puede ser muy pesada. En una machina probablamente podemos ejecutar cinco usuarios de Selenium, más o menos. Eso es importante si estamos tratando de simular miles de usuarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hay muchas herramientas basadas en Javascript que también podemos usar. Hay varias framework que se utilizan para adaptar Javascript y nodeJS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppeteer fue desarollado por Google. Tricentis Flood también ha diseñado Element que utiliza Puppeteer, pero con un enfoque en el rendimiento.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/microsoft/playwright&#34;&gt;Playwright&lt;/a&gt; es una creación de Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jest.io&#34;&gt;Jest&lt;/a&gt; fue desarrollado por Facebook&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mocha es otro framework que es la base para &lt;a href=&#34;https://cypress.io&#34;&gt;Cypress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todos esas herramientas son open source y gratis. También hay alternativas propietarias, pero prefiero las soluciones open source porque en la mayoría de casos hacen la misma cosa y se actualizan con más frecuencia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;element-script&#34;&gt;Element script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esto es un ejemplo de la misma acción, hacer clic en el botón Start en la aplicación Flood Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otra ventaja de simulando navegadores en vez de simulando las solicitudes es que es más simple crear un script. No tenemos que saber cada parámetro. Solo tenemos que describir lo que queremos que cada usuario virtual haga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podemos ejecutar scripts usando estas herramientas al mismo tiempo que un script de &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org&#34;&gt;JMeter&lt;/a&gt; o &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatling.io&#34;&gt;Gatling&lt;/a&gt; o lo que sea, y también tenemos la opción de reemplazar los script de protocolo con estas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusión&#34;&gt;Conclusión&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Para resumir, JMeter y otras herramientas de nivel protocolo tiene algunas limitaciones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No ejecutan scripts del lado del navegador&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pueden ser más complicado correlacionar parámetros dinámicos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No miden la experiencia final de un usuario&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Para solucionar estos problemas, podemos complementar pruebas de carga tradicionales, de nivel protocolo, como JMeter, con herramientas simulando navegadores. De este modo podremos tener una comprensión más completa del rendimiento total de la aplicación.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bueno, se acabó el tiempo, entonces los dejo aquí. Gracias por escuchar, y me disculpo por mi español. Gracias a todos!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week of Testing: Day 5 - The thing about learning in public</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20201128-week-of-testing-5/</link>

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/quoOYnweKw&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I mentioned that I&amp;rsquo;d used the &lt;code&gt;constant-vus&lt;/code&gt; executor to recreate the stepped load profile. Well, the thing about learning publicly is that it also means making mistakes publicly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was kindly informed by a few of my new colleagues that &lt;code&gt;constant-vus&lt;/code&gt; was not the most optimal way to recreate the stepped load profile. &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; wrote up a little function so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to repeat myself so much, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ppcano_&#34;&gt;Pepe Cano&lt;/a&gt; and Pawel Suwala (the CTO of k6 himself) both told me nicely that using &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/running-k6#stages-ramping-up-down-vus&#34;&gt;stages&lt;/a&gt; would have been the better solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s chalk that up to a TIL (Today I Learned) and record that snippet here for prosperity (found in the k6 documentation linked above):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;k6/http&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;check&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;k6&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;stages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; [
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;30s&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt; },
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;1m30s&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; },
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;20s&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; },
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  ],
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;};
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; () {

      <title>Week of Testing: Day 4 - Load profiles on k6</title>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;k6 has a cool feature where even if you start a load test locally via the CLI, you can still stream the results to k6 Cloud. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting compromise between debugging a test locally (and therefore not paying for cloud infrastructure) and sharing results for load tests run on the cloud. It worked seamlessly, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to see how to recreate a specific load profile that I commonly use - the stepped load profile. In JMeter, I typically do this with a plugin - the jp@gc Ultimate Thread Group is my thread group of choice. So, I created it in JMeter (I love that it shows a little image of it as well, while you&amp;rsquo;re building it) and then attempted to recreate it in k6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely had to look at the k6 documentation for this. I used the &lt;code&gt;constant-vus&lt;/code&gt; executor for this, but k6 has &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/scenarios#executors&#34;&gt;several other executors&lt;/a&gt; to choose from, and it worked as well as I had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, my experience with k6 has been positive. Things are well-documented, and they just work out of the box. No plugins necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week of Testing: Day 3 - Running a load test locally using k6</title>

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/y5tteMKZUqk&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had my fun playing around with k6 Cloud, the SaaS component. For Day 3, I thought it was time to jump into the heart of k6: k6 the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/loadimpact/k6&#34;&gt;open source load testing tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First impressions: logging was a little sparser than I expect, coming from having used load testing tools that just do this for me automatically. I think one of the first things I&amp;rsquo;ll do with k6 is to create my own little &amp;ldquo;load testing starting script&amp;rdquo; that I&amp;rsquo;ll always use, with all of the appropriate logging already set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I was really impressed with how quickly it installed. If you scrub over to the timestamp &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5tteMKZUqk&amp;amp;ab_channel=k6&amp;amp;ts=106&#34;&gt;1:46&lt;/a&gt; in the video, you&amp;rsquo;ll hear that I was actually expecting to have to speed up the installation process while editing to save time, but the installation actually finished before I could say that I was going to do so. By my count that was 7 seconds between hitting enter in my terminal and the download finishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t help but compare that to &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org/&#34;&gt;JMeter&lt;/a&gt;. JMeter is honestly probably my go-to load testing right now&amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s not good for absolutely everything, but it&amp;rsquo;s the tool that I reach for when I &amp;ldquo;just want to test this one thing&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it for years, and it&amp;rsquo;s the tool that I know the most. But one of the issues with JMeter is that there&amp;rsquo;s so much to do before it&amp;rsquo;s actually usable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you even open JMeter, you need to install Java, and when I first started in load testing, I spent a long time wrestling with getting setting the Java environment variable in Windows before my computer would even recognize that Java was installed. Then you need to install JMeter&amp;ndash; but any JMeter tester will tell you that there are some plugins that you just can&amp;rsquo;t do without, and that really you should always install. That&amp;rsquo;s why there are so many &amp;ldquo;best plugins in JMeter&amp;rdquo; lists (&lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20200414-aaf11&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s my top 3&lt;/a&gt;)&amp;hellip; because most of them are necessary, but you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know that if you&amp;rsquo;re new to JMeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that k6 starts up in 7 seconds is&amp;hellip; shockingly good.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week of Testing: Day 2 - Comparing tests against a baseline</title>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2 of my Week of Testing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I ran my first load test on k6, and actually set up the thresholds wrong. I still maintain that there are some UI improvements that could still be made in that area, and that feedback was well-received. Apparently I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one who has made the same mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I learned that on k6, you can actually set one test to be a baseline. There&amp;rsquo;s so much I want to say on this topic - that&amp;rsquo;s probably a whole blog post there - but for now, suffice it to say that having a baseline test to compare succeeding tests to is a key to a successful round of load testing. I was happy to see that k6 thinks so too, because that functionality is built into the UI by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think that being able to schedule a test regularly is fantastic for practicing Continuous Testing. Of course, teams already using CI/CD pipelines would probably get the most benefit out of running load tests using the command line rather than through the UI, but it&amp;rsquo;s nice to know that scheduling is an option in the UI as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my first real day of testing with &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io&#34;&gt;k6.io&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to jump right in and figure out how to run a load test on k6 Cloud. k6 has documentation on this, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t use it for this test, since the point of a week of testing is to record how easy the product is to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My verdict: I&amp;rsquo;m pleasantly surprised with how easily everything went. Is it just me, or was that AWS startup time exceptionally fast? I&amp;rsquo;m used to AWS taking at least a couple of minutes to provision a machine, but this seemed to start up almost instantaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zcYeboT5FYE&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was my first day at &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io&#34;&gt;k6.io&lt;/a&gt;! I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve joined as their newest Developer Advocate for Performance Testing. k6 is a company I&amp;rsquo;ve had my eye on for a while, even (or maybe especially) when I was working for a competitor, &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io&#34;&gt;Tricentis Flood&lt;/a&gt;. I always admired k6&amp;rsquo;s stance on open source, their involvement with the developer community, and the slick web app that brings load testing into the hands of many developers and testers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a load tester, I try to be tool-agnostic. I have to admit, though, that I do have a strong bias towards opensource tools. I joined Flood because of their focus on tools I already loved like &lt;a href=&#34;http://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi&#34;&gt;JMeter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatling.io/&#34;&gt;Gatling&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://element.flood.io&#34;&gt;Element&lt;/a&gt; (based on Puppeteer). (And Selenium, but it&amp;rsquo;s a stretch to say I love Selenium.) But these are tools I&amp;rsquo;ve used for years, most of them from even before I joined Flood. What kind of load tester would I be if I could only really talk about scripting in a handful of tools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I thought it was time for a change, and k6 was the first and only company on my list for a couple reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/loadimpact/k6&#34;&gt;The free and open source tool k6&lt;/a&gt;, which recently crossed over to 10,000 stars on Github, is often touted as the developer&amp;rsquo;s load testing tool of choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;k6&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/cloud&#34;&gt;cloud offering&lt;/a&gt; integrates seamlessly with the OSS tool, and it adds some killer features like performance insights that add real value to teams wanting to scale their load tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The k6 team is incredibly responsive to the needs of their community. Unlike most companies, where only marketing, sales, and customer support people talk to customers, k6 developers are active on GitHub, social media, and other blog sites. Everyone is passionate about what they&amp;rsquo;re building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roles in testing are changing, and the lines between tester and developer are blurring. Developers who don&amp;rsquo;t test are going to become just as obsolete as testers who don&amp;rsquo;t develop. I see k6&amp;rsquo;s popularity among the developer crowd as a good opportunity for me to sharpen my coding skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had to see for myself whether k6 was actually as good as it seemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, it turns out that k6 has a tradition of a &amp;ldquo;Week of Testing&amp;rdquo;, where every new member of the k6 team, regardless of role, spends their first week putting the product through its paces. Every part of the whole k6 solution (Cloud and OSS tool) is fair game, and the goal of the Week of Testing is to present feedback to the team at the end of it, while the new member&amp;rsquo;s eyes are fresh. When they told me about it, they said &amp;ldquo;We want to see you learn the tool on your own to see what parts are difficult to figure out.&amp;rdquo; To which I responded, &amp;ldquo;Challenge accepted!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to not only give a presentation at the end, but also to video the process for posterity&amp;rsquo;s sake&amp;hellip; and, let&amp;rsquo;s face it, to impress my new managers and coworkers with my dazzling work ethic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Get the company&amp;rsquo;s name right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first video, I share the differences between k6 vs. k6 Cloud vs. Load Impact!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/how-to-become-a-load-tester&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/how-to-become-a-load-tester&#34;&gt;Originally posted here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing can be a pretty intimidating field to get into, but it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get started. Here are some concrete steps you can take to start learning how to load test from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, Flood co-founder Tim Koopmans and I teamed up at Tricentis User Conference 2020 to talk about the essential ingredients for load testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_R2dmEmtO48&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-required-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;Background required for load testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing can be quite technical. It involves not just the ability to use different programming languages to create load testing scripts but also familiarity with software engineering practices, DevOps, application infrastructure, site reliability, and networking. A good load tester needs to be able to understand the basics of how an application works and how different components interact with each other. It&amp;rsquo;s common for a load tester to work on applications employing a variety of technologies, so staying up to date with recent technological trends and switching seamlessly from one language to another, or from one platform to another, is of utmost importantance. This technical side of load testing might make you think that a load tester needs to have formal studies in computer science and several years of experience in software testing. The reality is that there are many load testers who stumbled into the field from wildly unexpected backgrounds. So you might think load testing looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/how-to-become-a-load-tester01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&#34;https://unsplash.com/@wocintechchat?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&#34;&gt;Christina @ wocintechchat.com&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://unsplash.com/s/photos/meeting?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&#34;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sometimes it does. But it more often looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/how-to-become-a-load-tester02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&#34;https://unsplash.com/@youxventures?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&#34;&gt;You X Ventures&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://unsplash.com/s/photos/meeting?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&#34;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, load testing is an interdisciplinary field. So much of the job involves talking to people. Sometimes the requirements for a project are not clear, and someone needs to talk to the both the business and the developers to make sure that nonfunctional requirements are clarified. A load tester is a detective, tracing a request as it goes from one application component to another, coordinating with different application teams. A load tester is a scientist, using the scientific method to design experiments that yield the results. A load tester is a statistician, making sense of a jumble of data and seeking correlations between variables. A load tester is a public speaker. Even when the actual load testing has been completed and the report has been sent, a load tester makes sure all stakeholders understand the report so that the results can be used to make meaningful changes to improve application performance. All these tasks require a mishmash of skills and competencies that can be difficult to find in just the field of computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take our backgrounds as anecdotal examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim grew up and currently lives in a small country town in Australia, and he joined the military straight after school. He later developed a love of automating things, which led him first to use tools like perl to scrape websites and try to win bids with early versions of ebay, and then later to starting a performance engineering consulting career and co-founding Flood itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, Nicole, grew up in Metro Manila in the Philippines (which has 14,000 more people per km2 than Mumbai does). I learned English as a foreign language in school, and I have a university degree in Economics. When I discovered load testing, I had a job in a completely different field– I was working for an airline and making sure engine components were properly maintained and repaired. My love for gadgets and technology took me down an 8-year rabbit hole involving doing performance consulting for clients across a variety of industries in Australia and the Netherlands. At Flood, I help customers around the world improve their application performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, Tim and I came from very different backgrounds and different parts of the world. Neither of us knew what load testing even was when we started working. Neither of us got formal instruction in load testing. But somehow, we still both ended up becoming load testers at Flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reasons-to-become-a-load-tester&#34;&gt;Reasons to become a load tester&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why become a load tester? Here are some practical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;load-testing-is-cool&#34;&gt;Load testing is cool&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little-known fact about load testing is that it can be really satisfying to be involved in big-name projects that end up going live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have heard of Flood. But even if you haven’t, we’re sure you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with the results of load testing done on Flood. In the last few years, we have been helping Hotstar, one of the largest streaming services in the world, load test their systems in preparation for the Indian Premier League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hotstar uses an open-source tool that we support, Gatling, to create scripts to simulate users tuning in to watch cricket games. Then, they use Flood to create a “Game Day” simulation. They scale up those load tests and run 5 million users on thousands of machines in the cloud. We help them coordinate execution, spot problems quickly with real-time results from all those machines while the test is still running, and identify bottlenecks so that they don’t occur in production, when India’s playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a load tester, you&amp;rsquo;ll definitely be working with brands you recognize and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;load-testing-can-pay-well&#34;&gt;Load testing can pay well&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/how-to-become-a-load-tester03.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.payscale.com/research/IN/Job=Performance_Engineer/Salary&#34;&gt;Payscale&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I said this would be a practical list, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are 261,768 practical reasons. The average performance engineer’s salary is 71% more than that of an average software tester in India, according to Payscale.com. We all know that money isn’t everything, but this is a clear signal from the market about the importance of performance-related skills. Adding load testing to your CV as a tester makes you more attractive to employers. It’s a great way to differentiate yourself in an over-saturated market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;load-testing-can-literally-take-you-places&#34;&gt;Load testing can literally take you places&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the side benefits of being in load testing. The photos above are real ones from the Flood team. That’s me on the upper left, exploring a castle in Belgrade, Serbia, and that’s Tim in the bottom right, taking a photo in San Francisco, USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/inside-the-career-of-a-digital-nomad-is-a-life-on-the-road-right-for-you&#34;&gt;We’re a fully distributed team on Flood&lt;/a&gt;, which means we can work from anywhere. Flood is a web app, so you don’t need to install anything– I’ve been known to start load tests from my iPad in a café. Load testing on the cloud frees you from being tied to running tests from the office. You can start load generators when you need them and shut them down when you don’t– all from a web browser. It’s a job that can come with a great work/life balance, if you find the right company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing can also be a great way to move to another country. It’s what’s allowed me to move to other countries– twice. In Australia, the average performance engineer’s salary is AU$108,053, or over 5.6 million rupee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/how-to-become-a-load-tester06.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s clear that there are some pretty good reasons for you to become a load tester. I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk you through the practical steps to become a load tester. You may not be an expert by the end of this, but I hope I can convince you that you can get started in load testing whether your background looks like Tim’s or mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;load-testing-adds-real-value&#34;&gt;Load testing adds real value&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the trite, but absolutely true reason: Everyone fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a load tester, you are a gatekeeper of quality. What you do directly affects revenue and customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance is an aspect of software that is often overlooked, but it’s only becoming more important in a world where everything is going online. People are being born who have never known what it’s like not to have the internet, and consumers in general expect applications to be responsive and stable. Would-be customers who can’t get an e-commerce site to load within 3 seconds may switch to a competitor’s site, and we all know there are many of them. Performance-related outages can be seriously damaging to a company’s reputation, and social networking amplifies customer dissatisfaction by effectively giving everyone a megaphone to complain into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software functionality is still important. However, if an online store goes live with no critical functional defects, but it fails when the 100th person logs into it, or it takes 10 seconds to load the homepage, can you really say that it was ready for production?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing is a crucial part of ensuring software quality, and quality is the responsibility of everyone on a team, even if the word “performance” isn’t in your job title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-essential-ingredients-of-a-load-test&#34;&gt;The essential ingredients of a load test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing is like cooking a meal. This is one of Tim&amp;rsquo;s favorite dishes, aloo matar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/how-to-become-a-load-tester07.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cubesnjuliennes.com/aloo-matar-recipe/&#34;&gt;Cubes n Juliennes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can approach cooking as a science. There are recipes with a list of ingredients, a precise measurement of how much you need for each, and a procedure for creating the dish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can also look at cooking as an art. Cooking the same dish over and over again will give you an experience in working with those ingredients that a novice cook won’t have. There’s room in cooking for adding one ingredient, changing the quantity of another, or just trying something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A master chef knows how to use both the science and the art to create something delicious. But you don’t HAVE to be at that level in order to cook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can cook. If you know how to follow a basic recipe, you may not create a masterpiece, but if you’re like me and you haven’t had lunch yet, you’ll still end up with something you’ll eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s the recipe for load testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer kadai paneer myself, but aloo matar requires, among other things, peas. And so does load testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P is Preparation&lt;/strong&gt;. To prepare for a load test, you need to get your ingredients ready. You need to decide what it is you want to test, why you’re testing it, and how. You write load testing scripts that will simulate real users as closely as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E is Execution&lt;/strong&gt;. This is when you do the actual cooking. You run your load tests and scale them up according to your requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A is Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;. You figure out whether the dish you created is edible. You determine how your application servers responded during the load test, and decide if that’s acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation – Execution – Analysis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;preparing-for-a-load-test&#34;&gt;Preparing for a load test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As far as the World Cup is concerned, it is a process. We don’t want to jump to the 50th floor straight away. We must start on the ground floor.” - Sachin Tendulkar, via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/22538610/world-cup-final-dream-tendulkar&#34;&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing doesn’t start with writing a script. Load testing starts with building a foundation for later tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/how-to-become-a-load-tester08.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of that foundation is asking WHY. Why do you want to do a load test? Has there been a performance-related issue before? Are you trying to determine whether an application is ready to go live, or is it already live, and you just want to improve its performance? What type of application do you want to test?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHOM are you cooking for? I think you’d cook differently for yourself than you would for Sachin Tendulkar. What do your end users typically do on your site? Where do they come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are questions that need to be answered before you think about scripting. Here are some resource for planning your load tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/start-with-why-how-to-write-requirements-for-api-load-testing&#34;&gt;Start with Why: How to write requirements for API load testing&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/how-to-write-a-test-plan-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;How to write a test plan for load testing&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/ebooks/api-load-testing/scripting-an-api-load-test&#34;&gt;Selecting a tool for load testing&lt;/a&gt;
Generating a load testing script without coding: &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/overview-of-flood/scripting-your-load-test&#34;&gt;Getting Started with Test Builder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;execution-of-a-load-test&#34;&gt;Execution of a load test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we’re ready to start cooking. This is the Execution phase. You’ll need a machine to use as a load generator. Depending on the number of users you want to run with, you may need more than one machine. You might be tempted to run a load test on your laptop, or on a bunch of machines you have lying around, but that introduces new variables that may affect the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/how-to-become-a-load-tester09.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://unsplash.com/@suicide_chewbacca?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&#34;&gt;Ashwini Chaudhary&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://unsplash.com/s/photos/indian-food?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&#34;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any good cook, you’ll also need to make sure you have all your ingredients handy. In load testing, that means making sure your scripts and test data files are ready to be executed on every load generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these problems – provisioning a load generator and transferring files over to them – are solved pretty easily by running on the cloud using something like Flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing and executing your load test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where should you run your load tests? A look at demand, hosted, and on-premise infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis-of-results&#34;&gt;Analysis of Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last part is Analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/how-to-become-a-load-tester10.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.finedininglovers.com/recipes/brunch/potato-pakoras-yogurt-sauce&#34;&gt;Fine Dining Lovers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty crucial moment, because this is when you figure out whether what you cooked was delicious or not. Unfortunately, in load testing, it’s not always easy to tell how your test went. It’s like this photo of pakora (onion is my favorite kind). It’s kind of hard to say what expression that is in their faces. Is it disgust? Or is the pakora so yummy that they just can’t wait to eat more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing typically generates a LOT of data. You’d have to go copy every single file from every load generator you used. But can you imagine the hundreds of load generators that Hotstar used? Of course they didn’t manually copy those files. Instead, they used Flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Flood, we show real-time graphs as you’re running the test so that you can tell immediately whether transactions are failing or whether a server has stopped responding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the test, you can also compare this data to previous tests to spot trends, or even create your own dashboards using an analytics engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/results-analysis/metrics-during-test&#34;&gt;Real-time metrics during your load test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/results-analysis/archived-results&#34;&gt;Downloading results and logs after the test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-that-it&#34;&gt;Is that it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve prepared for a load test, you’ve executed a load test, and you’ve analysed the results from the load test. Congratulations, you’re a load tester! By following this recipe, you’re already doing better than many people, and you’re certainly doing a lot better than those who do not run any load tests at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cool thing about load testing, though, is that this is just the beginning. There’s always room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/how-to-become-a-load-tester11.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://popupcity.net/observations/dabbawalla-hot-lunch-delivery-by-mumbais-fastest/&#34;&gt;Pop Up City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dabbawallas are people who deliver hot lunches, and while the concept is not new, the implementation in India is particularly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these dabbawallas, having the meals prepared is not the end of the job. Once the food is ready, it needs to be packed into lunchboxes, picked up, separated according to destination, put on trains, and delivered. Later, the empty lunchboxes are picked up, and the system works in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that this is actually a pretty sophisticated system. In fact, it’s been estimated that only one tiffin every two months is not delivered. That’s equivalent to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170114-the-125-year-old-network-that-keeps-mumbai-going&#34;&gt;Six-Sigma quality rating of 99.9999999%&lt;/a&gt; (that’s nine nines) or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dabbawallas didn’t get that rating just by delivering quickly. They did it by being consistent and reliable. They did it by having a process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you see the benefits of running a load test, you may also start to understand that the real value of load testing is not in a test that you run once whenever you think of it. Imagine having the benefits of a load test tied to your development process, so that it is automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an advanced topic, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/load-testing-in-devops-pipelines-with-azure-and-flood&#34;&gt;adding your load testing&lt;/a&gt; to your team&amp;rsquo;s Continuous Integration/Continuous Development pipelines such as sets up a repeatable process that reaps benefits far into the future, not just whenever official load testing activities are carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/continuous-integration/what-is-continuous-integration&#34;&gt;Continuous Integration with Flood&lt;/a&gt;: Integrating Travis CI, Circle CI, and Jenkins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s the recipe for becoming a load tester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation – Execution – Analysis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Preparation&lt;/strong&gt;, you determine why you’re testing and what tool best fits your needs. We showed you how to use Element, but there are many open source tools out there. Don’t get overwhelmed by scripting– a lot of times it can just mean replacing a URL with the one YOU want to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Execution&lt;/strong&gt;, you run a baseline test that will serve as a point of comparison for future testing, choose the number of users and the number of regions you want, and then you run your test. Running on the cloud is the easiest (and usually cheapest) way to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;, you view the results in real-time, compare historical performance to see trends, and share reports to stakeholders so that your team can make changes to your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also talked about the bonus topic of &lt;strong&gt;CI/CD&lt;/strong&gt; and how you can incorporate load testing into your pipeline to get a continuous feedback during your development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim and I started in very different places and had different experiences before we discovered load testing. But eventually, we ended up on the same path, and that’s what we’ve outlined for you here. We hope that this convinces you that load testing doesn’t have to be complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You absolutely don’t need to be an expert to run a load test. Even if you don’t think you’ll get all these steps right, a load test that is less than ideal is still better than no load testing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, anyone can be a load tester with the right attitude and the right tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.testingtalks.com.au/presentations/lifting-the-lid-on-performance-testing-best-practices-from-leading-companies&#34;&gt;Testing Talks Online site&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance testing is an essential part of the quality assurance function. However, across the industry the great majority of companies still struggle to master and execute a successful performance testing strategy that produces measurable results.
In this panel discussion, Cameron Bradley will host some of the best performance engineers in the world. The panel will discuss how we as quality assurance experts and performance engineers can better understand performance testing, the value of performance testing and how world leaders are approaching and succeeding with performance testing as part of the delivery life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-20-how-can-fear-affect-application-performance-video&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about the power of fear, and how it can end up affecting performance test results.
‍

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or listen to the audio version here:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/2cOfQrrUwyIKWbztgNdoXR&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;232&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, I&amp;rsquo;m Nicole van der Hoeven, back with another Ask a Flooder, and today I want to talk about the effect of fear on your performance outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dutch-coronalijn&#34;&gt;The Dutch &amp;ldquo;coronalijn&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently live in Maastricht, in the Netherlands. At the beginning of this global pandemic, the only people getting tested actively for COVID-19 were either people who presented with serious symptoms of the disease, or health care professionals who were continually exposed to the disease and therefore at a higher risk of contracting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, on June 1st, the Dutch government made testing available to everybody. They set up a telephone hotline that any Dutch resident could call to set an appointment to get tested for a COVID-19 test. A task force was dispatched to make sure that they could test up to 30.000 people per day. Yet on the first day of testing, only 1.146 people were tested. So what happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it turned out that the bottleneck of the entire process wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting enough tests, registering the tests, or even processing the test results. The bottleneck actually occurred way before that, when people called up the hotline to get an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;323.000 people called on the first day that the hotline opened. And not even all of them had called to make an appointment. Some of them were just calling for general information on the coronavirus despite the fact that the government made it clear that that&amp;rsquo;s not what the line was for, and that there were other lines dedicated to information. There were reports on Twitter of people waiting up to 6 hours on the line just to talk to someone who would make an appointment for them. There were calls that got dropped. People said that sometimes it happened in the middle of a call. Even telephone operators that   the appointment system was down or slow and unusable for a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, only 5,500 people actually had appointments booked on a day where there were 323,000 that called. That&amp;rsquo;s 1.70%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-that-have-to-do-with-performance&#34;&gt;What does that have to do with performance?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As performance engineers, we like to believe that everything we do is reasoned. We design tests based on quantitative data. We look at historical trends and metrics to help us decide how to build a workload model. But the truth is that that&amp;rsquo;s often not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything, this pandemic has shown us just how wrong our guesses can be, whether or not they&amp;rsquo;re  informed by facts, especially when it has to do with human behavior. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen violent fights erupt over toilet paper. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen peaks and troughs on the stock market that didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything to do with the underlying companies. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen arson on 5G cell towers. Because human beings are irrational, and it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to capture that irrationality in our model for how users are going to behave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may never be able to accurate predict how irrationality is going to affect the load on our application in production. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t try. There are still things that we can do to mitigate the risk. I think that any application that is public-facing should be assessed for exposure to the risk of fear or other human psychological factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-we-account-for-fear-in-our-performance-testing&#34;&gt;How do we account for fear in our performance testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually wrote a whole blog post on this particular situation (the Dutch corona line), and how it might have been possible to predict (maybe not with 100% accuracy but with reasonable accuracy) how many people would have called the hotline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we can look at statistics like the of the Netherlands or how many people normally get flu-like symptoms or at least report them at this time of the year. These are statistics that are readily available from the Department of Health, and we could have used them to inform our decisions on the workload model for such an application. We may not have gotten it exactly, but we would have at least bin in the same ballpark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have a good enough idea about the workload that our application would have to handle when it&amp;rsquo;s influenced by fear, we can start running load tests around that. Another good open-ended kind of test to run, especially for applications that are particularly susceptible to fear, is the stress test. In a stress test, you push your application to its limits and you find out what they are. You could, for instance, start with your peak work load, and then add a certain number of users every 30 minutes and see how much your application can actually handle. You can do the same with soak tests, where you&amp;rsquo;re exposing your application to the same amount of load for an extended period of time. Both of those kind of exploratory tests help you define the limits of your application and how it would respond if fear plays a role in the workload model in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we overlook this critical human element in our test design, then we leave ourselves, and our applications, vulnerable to performance degradation and, perhaps, outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read &lt;a href=&#34;blog/20200813-dutch-coronavirus-hotline/&#34;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; for more about the coronavirus hotline.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-18-how-do-i-load-test-video-streaming-with-jmeter-video&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, I answer the question: &amp;ldquo;How do I load test video streaming with JMeter?&amp;rdquo;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q00briuogto&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or listen to the audio version here:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/69F5lmOeFfEJr6ZgVWFGOu&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;232&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;http-live-streaming-hls-and-performance&#34;&gt;HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular protocols for video streaming is &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/streaming/examples/&#34;&gt;HTTP Live Streaming&lt;/a&gt;, or HLS, and that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you today. An HLS video ends with the [file extension .m3u8‍](&lt;a href=&#34;https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/streaming/examples/bipbop_4x3/bipbop_4x3_variant.m3u8%5D(https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/streaming/examples/bipbop_4x3/bipbop_4x3_variant.m3u8)&#34;&gt;https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/streaming/examples/bipbop_4x3/bipbop_4x3_variant.m3u8](https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/streaming/examples/bipbop_4x3/bipbop_4x3_variant.m3u8)&lt;/a&gt;. According to the HLS protocol, when a video is streamed, the first request sent must be a manifest. A manifest is sometimes called a playlist, and it is a list of all the chunks or parts that make up the video. Then, each chunk is downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the performance of a video stream, we still want the response time of the manifest, the chunks, and the whole video. However, there are many more metrics that are important in video streaming which aren&amp;rsquo;t captured by just the response time. For example, how do you determine whether a video was played smoothly or if it stopped to buffer? A video that keeps pausing might just drive a user away, and it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to tell whether that is happening just from the response time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-load-test-video-streaming-with-jmeter&#34;&gt;How to load test video streaming with JMeter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;downloading-and-installing-the-ubik-video-streaming-plugin&#34;&gt;Downloading and installing the Ubik Video Streaming plugin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there&amp;rsquo;s a plugin for that, created by a company called Ubik Ingénierie. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://ubikloadpack.com/&#34;&gt;Ubik Load Pack&lt;/a&gt; is a set of enterprise-grade plugins for JMeter. One of those plugins is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ubikloadpack.com/video-streaming-performance.php&#34;&gt;Video Streaming Plugin&lt;/a&gt;, and it happens to be a really easy way to get started with video streaming. This is a paid plugin, but you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://ubikloadpack.com/video-streaming-performance.php#formulaire&#34;&gt;sign up for a free 11-day trial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you do that, you&amp;rsquo;ll get an email from Ubik with a link to download the bundle. Go to lib/ext and then copy this .jar file into the same directory on your JMeter installation. Start up JMeter, and it&amp;rsquo;ll ask you for the license file. Browse to the license file in the bundle you downloaded. JMeter will restart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-the-jmeter-plugin-in-your-load-testing-script&#34;&gt;Using the JMeter plugin in your load testing script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s start creating the Test Plan. Create a Thread group, and then right click on the thread group, go to Add &amp;gt; Sampler and then select the &amp;ldquo;ULP Video Streaming sampler&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the sampler and then paste in the URL to the HLS file that you&amp;rsquo;d like to test. This should end in a .m3u8. This plugin supports several protocols for video streaming, but we can just leave it at auto and it&amp;rsquo;ll automatically detect which one it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Play Options, you can choose whether to play the entire video or just a part of it, or even whether you want to include the video subtitles in your test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Network Options panel is fantastic because it allows you to limit your network speed. Slow networks, like mobile networks, really affect user experience, so it&amp;rsquo;s really important to take this into account when running load tests. You might even use a parameter here and do something like throttle to 3G speeds for 80% of your traffic, and leave it on Auto 20% of the time. But I&amp;rsquo;ll just leave this blank for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, let&amp;rsquo;s add a View Results Tree listener. Then, let&amp;rsquo;s run the script once, just to see if it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we can see the manifest retrieved first, and then all the chunks. We didn&amp;rsquo;t get any errors, so let&amp;rsquo;s run this as a load test. We can disable this listener because it just consumes extra resources on our load generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ramping-up-your-load-test-on-flood&#34;&gt;Ramping up your load test on Flood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ramp this up into a load test, we&amp;rsquo;ll have to go into Thread Group and change these settings. Ideally, we want to be able to change these values from the Flood UI later so we don&amp;rsquo;t have to go into the script whenever we change them, so I&amp;rsquo;ll type in these Flood-specific properties. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave a link in the description about these properties. I&amp;rsquo;ll also set it to run Forever so that we can change the duration and the video will just keep playing to fill that duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To capture some of Ubik&amp;rsquo;s cool metrics, let&amp;rsquo;s add a Simple Data Writer listener here and write the results to a CSV file. On Flood, all flood results are stored on /data/flood/results, so we&amp;rsquo;ll add an output.csv file in that directory that we can download after the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s our script! Now we&amp;rsquo;ll have to include the plugin and related files so that Flood can access them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go back to the bundle we downloaded and go to the bin folder to look for &lt;a href=&#34;http://user.properties/&#34;&gt;user.properties&lt;/a&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s open that up, and we&amp;rsquo;ll change the license path to &lt;code&gt;/data/flood/files&lt;/code&gt;, which is the directory that Flood saves files we upload to. To preserve this directory structure, we&amp;rsquo;ll compress just the lib and bin folders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Flood, we&amp;rsquo;ll start a new stream here and upload three things: the jmx script, the license, and the compressed archive of the lib and bin folders from the bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we&amp;rsquo;ll go through the rest of the process here, setting the test parameters. Time to launch the test!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analyzing-video-streaming-load-test-results&#34;&gt;Analyzing video streaming load test results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flood shows you results of your load test while it&amp;rsquo;s running as well as after the test. You can see metrics like concurrency, network throughput, transaction rate, and response time for the test. You can also see these metrics for each individual transaction, including the video or sampler as a whole, the manifest, and the chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see the CSV that our script generated, we can download the Archived Results from a flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In JMeter, click on Tools &amp;gt; Generate Report and fill in the fields, selecting the output.csv from the flood&amp;rsquo;s Archived Results, JMeter&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://user.properties&#34;&gt;user.properties&lt;/a&gt; file, and then an output directory for the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubik&amp;rsquo;s plugin creates a few custom graphs in the HTML report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffer fill in Millis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lag ratio in percentage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lag ratio without buffer fill in percentage&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Ubik&amp;rsquo;s Video Streaming plugin is an easy and thorough way to load test video streaming with JMeter, and I highly recommend it. I used an HLS video to demonstrate it, but this plugin supports several protocols:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HLS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mpeg DASH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smooth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adobe HDS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information, read Ubik&amp;rsquo;s tutorial on how to use their plugin with Flood &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/running-a-video-streaming-performance-test-using-flood-io-and-ubikloadpack&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-17-how-do-i-use-unique-test-data-on-element&#34;&gt;Tricentis Flood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about how to ensure that Flood Element uses unique test data, using the example of a customer wanting to script unique logins for his application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/qVpX7MX3jxE&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or listen to the audio version instead:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/7k5TXtoHnswJwBbKHXgJR7&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;232&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, Nicole van der Hoeven here again back with another Ask a Flooder, and this week&amp;rsquo;s question is a follow-up question from last week. That user had previously asked about test data in Flood Element. This week he&amp;rsquo;s asking: &amp;ldquo;How do I ensure that Flood Element uses unique test data?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this user is actually trying to script a login for an application. He has a list of usernames and corresponding passwords that he wants to use. He&amp;rsquo;s already set both of these up in a CSV file, and he&amp;rsquo;s also set up the Element script in the same way that I outline in my previous video. However, this user is seeing errors in the test due to the application not allowing a given user account to be used simultaneously in two or more devices. The problem is that the way that he&amp;rsquo;s set it up is that he has Element running on multiple nodes, and each node has the chance to pick the same user account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you make sure that it&amp;rsquo;s a unique 1:1 ratio for an instance of Element and a user account in the CSV file? If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already watched the previous week&amp;rsquo;s video, you should pause this, watch that, and then come back here, so it makes a little more sense because the script that I&amp;rsquo;m using is building on what we already did in the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the differences between this script and the previous week&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I&amp;rsquo;m declaring a global variable here called &lt;code&gt;globalBrowserID&lt;/code&gt;. The idea is to create a unique and globally identifiable string that I can attach to every account in the CSV file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;globalBrowserID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;FLOOD_GRID_INDEX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;_&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;FLOOD_GRID_NODE_SEQUENCE_ID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;_&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;BROWSER_ID&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global browser ID consists of three parts:- The first is a grid index, which is a number assigned to every grid, and it&amp;rsquo;s also globally unique. So if there are three grids being used in the test, then the grid indexes would be 0, 1, and 2.- The second one is a grid node sequence ID, and this is unique within the grid. The node sequence ID is a number that is assigned to every node in a single grid.- The last one is a browser ID. The browser ID is a number assigned to an instance of Element running on a single node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all zero-based, so the very first instance of Element running on the very first node and on the very first grid in the entire test would be &lt;code&gt;0_0_0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to have to modify our CSV file to make use of this browser ID. So whereas the user previously had username and password, I&amp;rsquo;ve added an ID column. From then, these will have to be sequential. So &lt;code&gt;0_0_0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0_0_1...&lt;/code&gt; And &lt;code&gt;0_0_1&lt;/code&gt; would be the second instance of Element running still on the first node, on the first grid. And you can make as many of these as you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;id,username,password
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;0_0_0,user1,password1
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;0_0_1,user2,password2
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;0_0_2,user3,password3
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1_0_0,user4,password4
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1_0_1,user5,password5
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also modified the interface &lt;code&gt;UserData&lt;/code&gt; to describe the fields in the CSV file. So there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;username&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;password&lt;/code&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;ve defined them all as strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;TestData&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;fromCSV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;UserData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;users_multiplegrids.csv&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  .&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;((&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;browserID&lt;/span&gt;) =&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;globalBrowserID&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  .&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;circular&lt;/span&gt;()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This line is telling Element to take this data file with this filename and filter it based on the line, the index, and the browserID such that &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; is equal to the browser ID. So what happens here is that Element will take the global browser ID, which let&amp;rsquo;s say is &lt;code&gt;0_0_0&lt;/code&gt; for the very first one. It&amp;rsquo;ll then take that &lt;code&gt;0_0_0&lt;/code&gt; and look at the CSV file for anything in the ID field that has the value &lt;code&gt;0_0_0&lt;/code&gt;. And then it will continue to use the rest of that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also made the CSV file circular just because that&amp;rsquo;s always a good practice to get into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as always, I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great idea to debug this, especially when you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with multiple grids and multiple nodes on that grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Print to console&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Browser&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;UserData&lt;/span&gt;) =&amp;gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;global browser ID: &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;globalBrowserID&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;| user: &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39; | password: &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;)    
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;})
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also added the username and password here, just in case we need to verify the state that that user is in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s run the test. Since we&amp;rsquo;re just running this locally, we&amp;rsquo;ll see that the first value indeed is &lt;code&gt;0_0_0&lt;/code&gt;, and the user we&amp;rsquo;re selecting is &lt;code&gt;user1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;password1&lt;/code&gt;, which lines up with the username and password values corresponding to &lt;code&gt;0_0_0&lt;/code&gt; in the CSV file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that helped, and until next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Download the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/flood-io/load-testing-playground/blob/master/element/test-data/example.ts&#34;&gt;full script&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/flood-io/load-testing-playground/blob/master/element/test-data/users.csv&#34;&gt;data file&lt;/a&gt; to follow along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-16-how-do-i-use-test-data-with-element-video&#34;&gt;Tricentis Flood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, I discuss how to make your load testing scripts more realistic by including test data. The load testing tool I use is &lt;a href=&#34;https://element.flood.io/&#34;&gt;Flood Element&lt;/a&gt;, but you can apply these principles to any tool. You&amp;rsquo;ll find a copy of the Element script I used below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EGhVm-R12qI&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, if you prefer, here&amp;rsquo;s the audio version:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/4OW5slSCmAuBc9NPa1NKtk&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;232&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, Nicole van der Hoeven here back with another Ask a Flooder, and this time the question is: How do I use test data with Flood Element?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s talk about why you might want to use test data. In load testing, it&amp;rsquo;s important to make your scripts behave as similarly to real users as possible so that the load that you generate is production-like. The problem is that if you send the same data over and over again to the server, that server is probably going to cache that response. The response being cached means that the server will return the response way faster than it normally would if it had been a unique request. So we can use test data, instead of static data hardcoded in your scripts, to make sure that this doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using test data can also help us test different responses. For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say we&amp;rsquo;re testing a loan application system, where a user inputs the application ID, the server looks it up, and returns the status of that loan application. Now, loan applications might be in different stages of the process. For instance, some might be saved but not submitted, or maybe they&amp;rsquo;ve been submitted but failed the identity verification check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we used the same application ID every time, then the server would always return the same status and the same details. Instead, let&amp;rsquo;s create a CSV file that we can use as test data. It might look something like this.‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;applicationId
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;A100001
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;B100002
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;C100003
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;D100004
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can have &lt;code&gt;applicationId&lt;/code&gt; as the single header here, and we can populate this with a list of different application IDs in different stages of the process. That way, when we run the script, the server will have to respond authentically to every request without it being cached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to create our script. This is an empty Element script. To start with, make sure you&amp;rsquo;re importing &lt;code&gt;TestData&lt;/code&gt; here in the first line of your script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;TestSettings&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Until&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;By&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Browser&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;TestData&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;@flood/element&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing we&amp;rsquo;re going to need to do is to create an interface for the CSV file. Let&amp;rsquo;s call it &lt;code&gt;AppData&lt;/code&gt;. Within this interface, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to define all the fields that we intend to use in our data file and what type of values we can expect to be in those fields. Looking at our CSV here, we&amp;rsquo;ve just got the application ID, so I&amp;rsquo;m just going to copy that, and it&amp;rsquo;s a mixture of characters and numbers, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to put that in as a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;AppData&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;applicationId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we need to tell Element how to find this test data. We&amp;rsquo;ll say that it&amp;rsquo;s from the CSV, using the interface we&amp;rsquo;ve just created. Now we&amp;rsquo;ll tell Element the filename. In this situation, the CSV file that I&amp;rsquo;m using is actually in the same directory, so I don&amp;rsquo;t need to specify a path here, but if you&amp;rsquo;re putting it somewhere else, then you&amp;rsquo;ll need to specify the folder and the path to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;TestData&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;fromCSV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;AppData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;applicationids.csv&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s use the data in a step. In real life, you might want to use an application ID to type it into a text field, but for demonstration purposes, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to show you how to output it to the console log. Printing to the console is also a good way to debug your tests, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with test data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to let Element know that we want to use AppData. So now, let&amp;rsquo;s output this to the console. Since we&amp;rsquo;re just debugging, let&amp;rsquo;s output the application ID. To actually get the value from the data file, we&amp;rsquo;ll use this syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Print to console&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Browser&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;AppData&lt;/span&gt;) =&amp;gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;application ID: &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;applicationId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;) 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;})
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍By default, Element reads the data files sequentially. The problem with that is we only have a handful of application IDs. So if we wanted to run this one script 100 times, we&amp;rsquo;re going to run out of data. What we can do here is add &lt;code&gt;circular&lt;/code&gt;. That way, when the script reaches the very last value of the file, the next value it selects will be the first one, and it never runs out of test data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;TestData&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;fromCSV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;AppData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;applicationids.csv&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)    
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  .&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;circular&lt;/span&gt;()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing you might be wondering is how to make it so that Element chooses a random value every time. To do that, we&amp;rsquo;ll also have to add &lt;code&gt;shuffle&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;TestData&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;fromCSV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;AppData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;applicationids.csv&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)    
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  .&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;circular&lt;/span&gt;()
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍Now let&amp;rsquo;s try to run the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;element run test-data.ts
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it&amp;rsquo;s been finished. The application ID that was selected was indeed a random one because the first one would have started with A. So, it actually chose the last one randomly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s it for test data with Element. Now, this user actually had a follow-up question, which was about unique test data. I&amp;rsquo;m going to answer that in the next video. Until next time, happy Flooding!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sample-script&#34;&gt;Sample script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;TestSettings&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Until&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;By&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Browser&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;TestData&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;@flood/element&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://guildconferences.com/speaker/nicole-hoeven/&#34;&gt;PerfGuild 2020&lt;/a&gt;, I spoke about hybrid load testing and how to mix two different approaches to load testing: protocol-based and browser-based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seamless access to other apps in the Google ecosystem, such as Search and Maps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think that adding support for GCP instances opens up a lot of  opportunities for flooders wanting to take advantage of these benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-flood-with-google-cloud&#34;&gt;Using Flood with Google Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll notice a new Google Cloud section in &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.flood.io/account/integrations&#34;&gt;the Integrations page&lt;/a&gt; while you&amp;rsquo;re logged into Flood:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200528-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need to add your GCP service account key to allow Flood to access your  account on your behalf. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve done this, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to start  grids and floods right from the Flood interface you&amp;rsquo;re already using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details on how to set up Flood to use your GCP account, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/infrastructure/host-your-own-infrastructure/using-your-own-google-cloud-account&#34;&gt;our documentation&lt;/a&gt; or follow along with the video below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a Flood subscription, including a free one, can use Google Cloud instances at no extra cost from Flood; however, GCP usage  may incur separate costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCP is the third cloud provider that we support at Flood, after &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/infrastructure/host-your-own-infrastructure/using-your-own-aws-account&#34;&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/infrastructure/host-your-own-infrastructure/using-your-own-azure-account&#34;&gt;Microsoft Azure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, Nicole van der Hoeven here again, back with another Ask a Flooder, and today&amp;rsquo;s question is: &amp;ldquo;How do I install Element?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I already made a previous video on how to get started with Element, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually go into the details of how to install it, so that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m going to do in this video today. There are actually a few parts to installing Element, and all of these instructions are going to be on &lt;a href=&#34;http://element.flood.io/&#34;&gt;element.flood.io&lt;/a&gt;. If you go onto the site and click on Install, you&amp;rsquo;ll see all of the instructions depending on which operating system you&amp;rsquo;re on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you need to install NodeJS. This is sort of like how, if you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with JMeter, you have to install Java before installing JMeter. NodeJS is what Element runs on. Secondly, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a package manager. You can use NPM or Yarn, but in this video, I&amp;rsquo;m going to take you through how to do it with Yarn. And thirdly, there&amp;rsquo;s installing Element itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, download NodeJS. I&amp;rsquo;m going to leave links in the description to all of the sites that I visit so that you can go through all of the instructions later. On the Node site, download whichever installer suits your operating system. Go through the installation steps, and afterwards, check to make sure that NodeJS is properly installed on your machine. You can do that by going into the terminal and typing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;node -v
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just make sure that the version that&amp;rsquo;s shown here is the same version that you&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, install the latest version of Yarn. On the Yarn site, you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to choose your operating system and the version. We recommend using the latest stable version. And then go through the instructions for your operating system. After you&amp;rsquo;ve done that, check your Yarn installation by typing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;yarn --version
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the last step is installing Element. On the Element site, you can find the exact code that you need to type into your terminal. It&amp;rsquo;s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;yarn global add @flood/element-cli 
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you can just copy that into your terminal. As of the time of this recording, the latest version of Element is 1.2.3. Looks like that&amp;rsquo;s installed. To check the version of Element, type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;element --version
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s how to install Element. We&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a lot of questions recently about Element in particular, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to answering them in future videos. Hope this helped, and until next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-13-how-do-you-do-mobile-load-testing&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-13-how-do-you-do-mobile-load-testing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you load test a native mobile app? I discuss the general approach to mobile load testing, what a device farm is, and why a device farm isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary for load testing. I also discuss the best mobile load testing tools to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_rRu0cDey4&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or listen to the audio version here:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/2fevtJd7pPIAUDkMpdnzkV&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;232&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, Nicole here again, back with another Ask a Flooder, and today&amp;rsquo;s question is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-you-do-mobile-load-testing&#34;&gt;How do you do mobile load testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this question came from a customer who was under the misconception that in order to do mobile load testing, they would need to use what we call a device farm. A device farm is a collection of different kinds of mobile phones. You would ideally have the most popular makes of mobile phones (the hardware models) and the operating systems and system versions. You can imagine that this can very easily get a little out of hand to coordinate because of fragmentation. There are just so many devices out on the market, and then there&amp;rsquo;s the question of how you actually generate the load from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would somehow need some sort of test automation script that was running and then coordinate os that they all run at the same time, and you would use that as a load test. As you can imagine, whether you use real devices or simulators, this kind of thing would get complicated and expensive very quickly. But the good news is that it&amp;rsquo;s unnecessary if it&amp;rsquo;s load testing that you want to do. Now I say that because, for functional testing or compatibility testing, you ARE going to want to test your application on a variety of different browsers. But with load testing, you&amp;rsquo;re really more concerned about the back end part of the equation. You want to generate load on your application servers. In reality, most mobile apps work by sending API requests to that server, usually by some sort of restful API. Luckily, API load testing has been around for a while, so we do have some industry-tested ways to run this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-best-tools-for-api-load-testing&#34;&gt;What are the best tools for API load testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, you&amp;rsquo;re going to want to test protocol-level tools. That means that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be using browser-level tools in which you&amp;rsquo;re using scripts to drive a full browser. All you really need is something that sends requests on the protocol-level. That&amp;rsquo;s great because it&amp;rsquo;s actually way more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have two really good open-source options for this, JMeter and Gatling. I&amp;rsquo;ve already gone a little bit into the differences between these two in my previous video on how you choose a tool for load testing, which I will leave a link to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are some other resources that will help you get started with mobile load testing. I also have another video about how to record network traffic from a native mobile app on JMeter, which sounds a little complicated, but I promise it&amp;rsquo;s not. In that video, I go over the steps with you, and I&amp;rsquo;m actually doing it in real-time with you as well. I show you the screen recording from my mobile and from JMeter on my laptop, so you can always pause and watch it at your own pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing is that I already wrote a blog post, which is sort of a guide for mobile load testing, which goes into the steps into way more detail than I can here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly, I have written blog posts about two real-life examples of mobile load testing. The first one was the Iowa Caucus Reporter app. I ran through it from the workload modeling to the scripting and then the actual execution. More recently, I also wrote about the Robinhood app. Be sure to check out the links in the description to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-12-puppeteer-vs-selenium-which-one-is-better-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to software testing, the debate of Puppeteer vs Selenium is a hot one. Nicole tackles it here to determine which one is better for load testing in particular. Spoiler: The answer is still &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/K61W7ivhsuE&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or catch the audio version here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, Nicole here again, back for another Ask a Flooder, and today, the question is: &amp;ldquo;Puppeteer vs. Selenium: which one is better for load testing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re actually getting this quite a bit now as Puppeteer grows in popularity, but first, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss the similarities. They&amp;rsquo;re tools that you can use to drive browsers. The work by identifying and interacting with elements on a website in the same way that a user would. They are also both open-source, and both can be used for load testing. This is a great strategy because instead of writing tests for an automation suite and then tests for load testing, you can just write the one test suite and re-use it, so it saves a lot of resources in the end. To answer this question, I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus on load testing because that&amp;rsquo;s what my experience is in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;difference-between-selenium-and-puppeteer&#34;&gt;Difference between Selenium and Puppeteer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pros-and-cons-of-selenium&#34;&gt;Pros and cons of Selenium&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the difference. Selenium supports more browsers than does Puppeteer. It supports Chrome, Firefox, IE, Safari, and Opera, so there are a lot more options to choose from depending on your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selenium is also what I would call automation-first. It was built with automation in mind, which means it&amp;rsquo;s very good at that. It&amp;rsquo;s very robust, and if you have a complicated test scenario, Selenium is an excellent choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also been around for much longer than Puppeteer, which is important because that means it&amp;rsquo;s had more time to build up a community. There are way more resources and tutorials for Selenium than for Puppeteer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also, unfortunately, very resource-intensive. That&amp;rsquo;s not something that you would typically care too much about from a test automation perspective, but when you&amp;rsquo;re running thousands of users on the cloud, it IS important to keep in mind that Selenium, just because of how it&amp;rsquo;s built and its complexity, can only run about five users per node. We&amp;rsquo;ve found that out at Flood, after baselining specifically an AWS m5.xlarge instance. So you can look at the specs of that and compare it with the machines that you&amp;rsquo;re wanting to run Selenium on, to see how that would equate for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pros-and-cons-of-puppeteer&#34;&gt;Pros and cons of Puppeteer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppeteer is a NodeJS library developed by Google, which means it plays very well with Chrome. There are a whole lot of things that you have access to with Puppeteer, and if you&amp;rsquo;re using it with Chrome, pretty much anything in Chrome, including rendering times, you can see and access with a Puppeteer script. So that&amp;rsquo;s a huge advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that also means it supports fewer browsers. Obviously, it supports Chrome very well, and they recently came out with support for Firefox, although they do have plans to incorporate support for more browsers in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Puppeteer&amp;rsquo;s advantages is that we at Flood actually created a tool on top of Puppeteer. It&amp;rsquo;s also open-source. It&amp;rsquo;s called Flood Element, and Element is built to be performance-first because obviously, that&amp;rsquo;s what we had in mind when we were building it. It takes everything that&amp;rsquo;s good about Puppeteer and makes it really easy to set parameters that you normally would expect to need for load testing, like users and ramp-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also means that it&amp;rsquo;s way less resource-intensive. I said that with Selenium, you can run up to five users on an AWS m5.xlarge instance, and for the same instance type, you can run, from our experiments, anywhere from 30-50 Element scripts/users. That is a huge saving when you&amp;rsquo;re running a really large-scale test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;should-you-choose-selenium-or-puppeteer-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;Should you choose Selenium or Puppeteer for load testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say that if you already have a large Selenium automation suite, if you have a complex test scenario, or if you aren&amp;rsquo;t running that many users for your load test, then Selenium is a great choice. If you ARE running thousands of users, though, and resource efficiency, and therefore cost efficiency, is really important to you, then choose Element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice is always to try both. If you have the time, do a proof of concept with both of them. That way, your whole team can better understand what the pros and cons are for each one and decide which one is best going forward. Or maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t even decide on one. At Flood, we support both of them at the same price, so it depends on what you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about how to install the JMeter Plugin Manager as well as other plugins, what the best JMeter plugins are, and why you need them. JMeter is an open-source load testing tool that is already robust, but there are some fantastic plugins that have been developed for it that you might want to use in your next load test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, Nicole here, back again for another Ask a Flooder, and I hope everybody is staying alert, not anxious, during these crazy times. In today&amp;rsquo;s Ask a Flooder, our customer asks: &amp;ldquo;What are the best JMeter plugins?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So first, I want to talk about what a JMeter plugin is and how you can actually install one. Apache JMeter is a really great, robust load testing that is one of my personal favorites. There are still some things that could be done better or could be extended, and the great thing about being an open-source tool is that anybody, pretty much, can just jump in and develop these plugins for JMeter to extend functionality, so that it supports more protocols or to customize load profiles in a way that is easier. We already have &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/blog/jmeter-plugins-the-top-10-plugins-and-how-they-help&#34;&gt;a blog post on this&lt;/a&gt;, and I will leave a link to that article as well in the description because it goes into a lot more detail. However, I still want to give you my personal top 3 JMeter plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-you-install-a-jmeter-plugin&#34;&gt;How do you install a JMeter plugin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can install a plugin for JMeter in two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is to download it from &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter-plugins.org/&#34;&gt;JMeter Plugins&lt;/a&gt;, which I will give you a link to, and then you paste that into either the lib — it&amp;rsquo;s usually in the lib folder, but it could be in the ext (extensions) folder. Each plugin is going to differ as to what you need to copy into what folder, but that&amp;rsquo;s why I prefer the second method, which is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/PluginsManager/&#34;&gt;Plugin Manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plugin Manager is a plugin itself, so you will initially need to do that copy and pasting of the jar file. Once you have the JMeter Plugin Manager installed, downloading and installing a plugin is as simple as choosing which ones you want and then clicking install. JMeter restarts, and that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much it. So I do recommend that the Plugin Manager be the first plugin that you install. But that&amp;rsquo;s still not my top 3 favorite - that&amp;rsquo;s just an optional step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-top-3-jmeter-plugins&#34;&gt;What are the top 3 JMeter plugins?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;custom-thread-groups&#34;&gt;Custom Thread Groups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the actual plugins. My #1 favorite is the Custom Thread Groups. See, with JMeter, you get the standard default thread group, and all that does is it asks you how many users you want to run, how many loops, the duration, and the ramp-up. That&amp;rsquo;s it. So that&amp;rsquo;s good for a lot of uses, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really help you in cases where maybe you want to plan a spike test, and you want to make sure that all the users have fully ramped up and gotten to a certain point, and then all hit the server at once. Or maybe you want to do a step load. Previously I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed stress testing and how a step load can be useful for that. In that case, the Thread Group doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite cut it because it only ramps up a user, and then it continues at the same level of load for the duration of the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you want any sort of variation in the middle (increasing users or decreasing), then you&amp;rsquo;re going to want something else.The Custom Thread Groups plugin has a lot of different types of thread groups. My favorite is the Ultimate One because you can probably do almost anything on that one. It also has the Stepping, Concurrency, Arrivals, and Free-Form Arrivals, so you have quite a few options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;throughput-shaping-timer&#34;&gt;Throughput Shaping Timer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugin #2 is the Throughput Shaping Timer. I love it because not a lot of load testing tools, even the proprietary ones, actually have this. This is really handy when you have a project where you&amp;rsquo;re given a requirement that isn&amp;rsquo;t in terms of the number of users; it&amp;rsquo;s in terms of hits per second, or requests per second, or something to do with the actual throughput of the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with that is that the throughput tends to change, so you can&amp;rsquo;t actually take as a given that it&amp;rsquo;ll remain constant for the duration of the test. Things like response time or latency are going to affect that throughput. For instance, when you have one user or one thread that&amp;rsquo;s running, and it sends a request and receives the response back in one second, you can&amp;rsquo;t necessarily say that that&amp;rsquo;s going to be the same when there are a thousand threads doing the same thing. The server&amp;rsquo;s under more load, so maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll take five seconds instead of one second— but that&amp;rsquo;s already changed your throughput. Before, one thread was doing one request per second, and now it&amp;rsquo;s doing one request every five seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it can get a little complicated, and the Throughput Shaping Timer is one of my favorites because it promises to solve all that. The Throughput Shaping Timer dynamically changes the think time, so at the beginning of a test, for instance, when there are no response time issues and requests are being returned really quickly, it might increase the think time so that it slows down your load test. So you&amp;rsquo;re not going over that throughput that you wanted to maintain. And then later on in the test, when all the users are ramped up, then it&amp;rsquo;ll decrease the think time that it uses. So it&amp;rsquo;s great because you just have this consistent throughput throughout your test. It&amp;rsquo;s a really intelligent way to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do want to say, though, that you do also want to play around with this a bit and make sure you understand how this works. One page could have several requests in it, and you&amp;rsquo;ll want to take that into consideration when you&amp;rsquo;re choosing what to set in that timer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;http2-request-sampler&#34;&gt;HTTP/2 Request Sampler&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My #3 is the HTTP/2 Sampler. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what HTTP/2 is, it&amp;rsquo;s an upgraded or next-generation protocol to the normal HTTP that we already use. The HTTP/2 protocol is supposed to be faster and more efficient, so more and more web apps are switching to it because of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that JMeter&amp;rsquo;s HTTP request sampler is only really for HTTP sites, so the HTTP/2 sampler is an upgraded version of the HTTP sampler. It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to use. The experience is pretty much going to be the same for you, but in the background, it uses the faster HTTP/2 protocol rather than the slower one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague, Jason Rizio, actually &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/blog/jmeter-tutorial-http2-test&#34;&gt;wrote a whole blog post about this&lt;/a&gt;, so if you want to learn more, I will put a link in the description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that answered your question, and until next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/introducing-flood-agent-standalone-infrastructure-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/introducing-flood-agent-standalone-infrastructure-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working from home during this pandemic and wondering how to start load tests from the office? Today, we&amp;rsquo;re officially introducing Flood Agent, a way to turn your own physical or virtual machines into load generators that you can control from anywhere with an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing Flood Agent on a machine lets you start load tests on it remotely from Flood—even if it&amp;rsquo;s within a corporate VPN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flood Agent is a simple binary that you can install on Linux, macOS, and Windows machines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve installed Flood Agent, your machines show up on the Flood web app to use as load generators or grids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;boldly-going-where-no-one-has-gone-before&#34;&gt;Boldly going where no one has gone before&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing within your company&amp;rsquo;s VPN and trying to coordinate it from home is like being on a maintenance pod trying to contact your starship, but a Mazarite ship is broadcasting a jamming signal, so comms are down. That Mazarite ship is your company&amp;rsquo;s firewall, and it can make testing difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way around this is to provision load generators in the cloud. However, because your application servers are still behind a firewall, you&amp;rsquo;d need to convince IT security to &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/test-execution/infrastructure/static-ip-addresses#hosted-grids&#34;&gt;whitelist the IP addresses&lt;/a&gt; of the load generators. Depending on how tight security policies are, this may not be an option even in this new world of remote working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flood Agent is a way to start load tests on Flood from the load generators you already have. It&amp;rsquo;s a cross-platform agent that you can install on your regular load generators, allowing you to control them on Flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flood Agent is kind of like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg#Borg_Collective&#34;&gt;Borg Collective&lt;/a&gt;. Each machine that you install Flood Agent on is assimilated into the Borg. A hive mind (you, on the Flood site) controls all Borgs, coordinating test execution with robotic efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/J6P7vFEQ6PcgE/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out this video to follow along as I walk you through the process of setting up Flood Agent, or you can keep reading for the text version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍

&lt;/div&gt;

‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-and-configuring-flood-agent&#34;&gt;Installing and configuring Flood Agent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flood Agent is a free binary, and it runs on Linux, Mac, or Windows machines. You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/flood-io/flood-agent/releases/latest&#34;&gt;download the appropriate version&lt;/a&gt; for your operating system and then follow the installation instructions here for more information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/infrastructure/standalone-infrastructure/getting-started-on-linux&#34;&gt;Getting started on Linux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/infrastructure/standalone-infrastructure/getting-started-on-macos&#34;&gt;Getting started on macOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/infrastructure/standalone-infrastructure/getting-started-on-windows&#34;&gt;Getting started on Windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing Flood Agent, you can configure it according to how you want to use it. Start Flood Agent in your terminal and use the configure functionality. Here&amp;rsquo;s what that command looks like on macOS, but you can follow the links above for other operating systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;./flood-agent configure
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;linking-your-flood-account&#34;&gt;Linking your Flood account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command above yields a prompt for a token like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This token allows Flood to run load tests on the load generator that you&amp;rsquo;ve installed Flood Agent in. To get the token, go to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.flood.io/account/api&#34;&gt;API Access page&lt;/a&gt; on your Flood account (&lt;a href=&#34;https://app.flood.io/sign-up&#34;&gt;you already have one, don&amp;rsquo;t you?&lt;/a&gt;) and click REVEAL token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should see a string of characters like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy your token (anything after the = sign) and paste it into the Flood Agent terminal window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;choosing-load-testing-tools&#34;&gt;Choosing load testing tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, you can choose which tools you&amp;rsquo;d like to set up and which version of those tools Flood Agent uses to run your tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-06.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with JMeter, Flood Agent asks you which of the tools you&amp;rsquo;d like to configure. You can choose to set up your tools at the beginning so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to set them up again, or you can go back to this configuration wizard at any point to add another tool. Either way, you need to provide the tools that you select in one of two ways: via a Docker image supplied by Flood, or via a &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/infrastructure/standalone-infrastructure/getting-started-local-jmeter-and-gatling&#34;&gt;local installation&lt;/a&gt; that you already have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this example, I chose to configure JMeter and to use a local installation. Local installations give you the most flexibility because you can use the version of the tool that you prefer, along with any special plugins. However, if you already have Docker installed or don&amp;rsquo;t want to manually install JMeter separately, you can also use our Docker image for JMeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting a local installation prompts you to provide the location of that directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-07.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For JMeter, this looks something like &lt;code&gt;/Users/nvanderhoeven/jmeter/apache-jmeter-5.1.1.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you enter this file path, Flood Agent checks to make sure the directory is valid. You can also set the configuration for other tools in this dialog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-08.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you finish the configuration, the wizard writes to a config.yaml file in your Flood Agent directory. You can also edit this configuration file directly in the future if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;verifying-flood-agent-configuration&#34;&gt;Verifying Flood Agent configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run a final check on whether Flood Agent has been installed correctly, type &lt;code&gt;./flood-agent check&lt;/code&gt;. You should see a summary of the configuration options you selected as well as some connectivity and validity checks, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍
&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-09.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These green check marks mean you&amp;rsquo;re good to go! If you&amp;rsquo;re running Flood Agent from within a corporate network, though, you may see some errors here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubleshooting-network-connectivity-within-a-corporate-network&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting network connectivity within a corporate network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your company already has a web proxy, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/infrastructure/standalone-infrastructure/deployment/integrating-with-a-web-proxy&#34;&gt;our guide on running floods through this proxy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please ensure that the load generator that you&amp;rsquo;ve installed Flood Agent on has access to the following endpoints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;https://drain.flood.io&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;https://beacon.flood.io&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;https://vault.flood.io&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;https://flood-archives.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;https://logs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;https://sns&amp;gt;.*.amazonaws.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;https://sqs&amp;gt;.*.amazonaws.com
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may need to request these from your IT department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get stuck, please contact us at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:support@flood.io&#34;&gt;support@flood.io&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;d love to go over your specific situation and get you up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Flood Agent returns a successful check, you can start up your own grid!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;turning-your-machine-into-a-flood-grid&#34;&gt;Turning your machine into a Flood grid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A grid, in Flood terminology, is a group of machines to be used for load generation. To make your machine a grid, run this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;./flood-agent --grid askaflooder
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;askaflooder&lt;/code&gt; is the name of your grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-10.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you see those [agent] ready and awaiting next job messages, you&amp;rsquo;re ready to run your test!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;running-a-load-test-on-your-own-infrastructure&#34;&gt;Running a load test on your own infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Log into your account on Flood, if you aren&amp;rsquo;t already, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/overview-of-flood/scripting-your-load-test#creating-a-stream&#34;&gt;create a new stream&lt;/a&gt; like you normally would, uploading your load testing script and data files. When &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/overview-of-flood/launching-your-test&#34;&gt;launching your test&lt;/a&gt;, though, select the option for Hosted infrastructure and then choose the grid with Flood Agent running on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-11.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead and launch your test. Congratulations, you&amp;rsquo;re now set up to run a load test on your on-premise load generators!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;giving-it-a-go&#34;&gt;Giving it a go&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flood Agent is a free download, so you&amp;rsquo;ll only need to pay when you run load tests on Flood. However, we also have a free tier— perfect for a proof-of-concept while you&amp;rsquo;re working from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions about Flood Agent, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/infrastructure/standalone-infrastructure/flood-agent&#34;&gt;our documentation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:support@flood.io&#34;&gt;email us&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;d be happy to get you started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-10-what-is-the-difference-between-load-testing-and-stress-testing-video&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between load testing and stress testing? When should you choose to run a load test on your application, and when is a stress test more appropriate? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s all in the intention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, Nicole here again, back with another Ask a Flooder, and this time the question is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-difference-between-load-testing-and-stress-testing&#34;&gt;What is the difference between load testing and stress testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, again, this is a matter of semantics, but I think the difference is in the intention. Load testing and stress testing are both types of back-end performance testing, and I did also make a video on it that I&amp;rsquo;ll link in the description down below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;load-testing-is-about-seeing-how-your-server-reacts-to-finite-load&#34;&gt;Load testing is about seeing how your server reacts to finite load&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with load testing, you usually have to start with a specific idea of the load profile that you want to test. You get to this number by looking through your Google Analytics or other analytics on your site to see what load you need to test at, and then the intention is to see how your server responds to that load. So the load is fixed: you know WHAT you want to test, and you just want to see how the server reacts to it. So it&amp;rsquo;s more finite in scope. In general, it&amp;rsquo;s also more about how your server reacts to normal or expected load, whether that&amp;rsquo;s now or in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stress-testing-explores-your-applications-upper-limits&#34;&gt;Stress testing explores your application&amp;rsquo;s upper limits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress testing, on the other hand, is a little bit more open-ended and a little bit more destructive. So instead of starting with how much load you want to put on [your server], in stress testing, what you generally do is you increase the load. You usually use a step load profile: so you start a certain number of users, you wait maybe 30 minutes, and then you increase it again. And you end up with this staircase kind of load profile. What you&amp;rsquo;re doing there is you just let it increase until your server fails because the intention of stress testing is to get your server to fail. And, once it fails, does it fail gracefully? Does it show an error message? These are really things that test the upper limits of your server, and that&amp;rsquo;s what stress testing really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;they-can-be-interchangeable&#34;&gt;They can be interchangeable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Flood, we tend to use the word &amp;ldquo;load&amp;rdquo; testing to refer to both kinds of testing because both of them entail applying load on your application server. It&amp;rsquo;s not really that important to distinguish between one or another; what&amp;rsquo;s [important] is that your team uses the same definition so that when YOU say &amp;ldquo;load testing,&amp;rdquo; they know what you mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-09-what-are-the-best-tools-for-load-testing-video&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-09-what-are-the-best-tools-for-load-testing-video&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our most commonly-asked questions is: &amp;ldquo;What are the best tools for load testing?&amp;rdquo; The answer will depend on a few things: your reason for load testing, the application you want to test, what kind of load testing you want to carry out, your team&amp;rsquo;s experience with scripting, and how many virtual users you want to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: In this video, I say that traditional load testing tools can&amp;rsquo;t simulate requests that are triggered by interactions on the client-side. This isn&amp;rsquo;t technically true: if you know what the requests are, you can build those requests manually on a protocol-level tool (like JMeter or Gatling). However, this takes more work compared to browser-level tools that just do this natively.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, Nicole back again with another Ask a Flooder, and this time I&amp;rsquo;m tackling one of the questions we get asked A LOT, which is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-best-tools-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;What are the best tools for load testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-open-source-load-testing-tools-are-awesome&#34;&gt;Why open-source load testing tools are awesome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I want to preface this by saying that we really love open-source tools here at Flood, because 1) they&amp;rsquo;re really pretty full-fledged these days. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to make any compromises on features, and, in fact, some of these open-source tools have more features than some newer load testing tools just because they&amp;rsquo;ve been out longer. And secondly, they have large communities. Because they&amp;rsquo;re open-source, lots of people are using it, and lots of people are developing for it. So there are lots of plugins normally, and they support any kind of protocol that you can think of. And lastly, cost. It&amp;rsquo;s hard not to mention cost because it can be a really important factor depending on the budget of your project. And if you&amp;rsquo;re starting out as a load tester, I think that it might even be the best way to start with load testing, because you can take that knowledge with you and apply it to other projects and other companies regardless of the budget that they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;questions-to-ask-yourself-in-choosing-a-load-testing-tool&#34;&gt;Questions to ask yourself in choosing a load testing tool&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-are-you-doing-load-testing&#34;&gt;Why are you doing load testing?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always advocate starting with WHY. Why are you actually load testing? Is there a particular production defect that you noticed that you&amp;rsquo;re trying to solve? Is there already a problem, or are you just preparing to launch? These are things that are going to inform the type of tool that you use because you might want to make sure that that tool supports the protocols that you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-are-you-load-testing&#34;&gt;What are you load testing?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, what type of app are you testing? Because if you have a single-page app, where your end-user is interacting with the page and client-side scripts are running to make requests to servers, then that&amp;rsquo;s something that most traditional load testing tools aren&amp;rsquo;t going to be able to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two general types of load testing tools: there&amp;rsquo;s browser-based, and there&amp;rsquo;s protocol-based. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave a link in the description talking about the differences between the two, but in general, if you want to go for browser-level testing, I would suggest Selenium and Element. Now, they&amp;rsquo;re both very good options. Selenium is probably the more robust in terms of automation of the two, but Element is better one in terms of efficiency because it was built with performance in mind. So Selenium&amp;rsquo;s automation-first and Element is really performance-first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for protocol-level tools, you can&amp;rsquo;t go wrong with either JMeter or Gatling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-experience-does-your-team-have-with-scripting&#34;&gt;What experience does your team have with scripting?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, what&amp;rsquo;s the level of technical expertise that your team has? I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to be realistic about what your team can do, given the amount of time that they have. So if you have a team that has never done load testing and has never done any scripting before, then I would suggest using our Test Builder or something similar. On Flood, we have a Test Builder that is really just an easy interface that actually runs JMeter under the hood, but it just kind of simplifies JMeter and boils it down to what are the URLs that you want to test. That is a really easy way to get started, and it&amp;rsquo;s also a great [way to run a] proof of concept. If you have some automation testers on your team that are trying to do the load testing, well, maybe you should stick to tools that they already use. So it might be easier for them to get up and running with either Selenium or Element rather than learning a new tool. And if you have developers on your team, you might consider Ruby JMeter rather than the vanilla JMeter because Ruby JMeter is a lot easier to deal with&amp;mdash; because you don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with the XML files of a JMeter file (a normal JMX script). You can just plan out your load tests in Ruby. Or, Gatling is also a really good option because it allows you to write scripts in Scala. Scala is really really powerful, and you can create an entire framework with Gatling, which is also something to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-many-virtual-users-do-you-want-to-run-in-your-load-tests&#34;&gt;How many virtual users do you want to run in your load tests?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly, how many users do you want to simulate? Now protocol-level tools are going to really shine here because Element and Selenium both require a higher usage of resources on your load generators just because of the complexities involved in starting a browser instance, whereas protocol-level tools are just super efficient at sending these requests. So I would suggest that if you&amp;rsquo;re talking about thousands of users, I would use the protocol-level tools unless there&amp;rsquo;s a really good reason why that&amp;rsquo;s not going to give you the results that you&amp;rsquo;re looking for. Between JMeter and Gatling&amp;ndash; well, they&amp;rsquo;re both excellent tools, but Gatling has been shown to particularly be good for really high levels of usage. But JMeter is also a good alternative, and you can run thousands of users of JMeter without any problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;just-get-started&#34;&gt;Just get started!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, I&amp;rsquo;d suggest just getting started. Pick whatever tool sounds like it might be the best for you, do a proof of concept on that one, and you can always try the other ones as well. On Flood, we don&amp;rsquo;t restrict you to just using one tool, so you can use one; you can use all four; you can run them at the same time if you want. It all depends on what you need for your testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the meaning of concurrent users in performance testing? You might have seen concurrent users in JMeter or other tools, but what does it mean and how can you use the term properly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uJE2hm50TIw&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! Nicole here again for another Ask a Flooder, except this time it&amp;rsquo;s not really a question&amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s just something I want to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200326-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: The &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/flood_io/status/1224284942932332544&#34;&gt;Flood Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m going to put the tweet up here, but last month I actually tweeted about something that somebody else posted. Netflix actually reported some of their viewership figures, and one thing that they reported was that 76 million households watched their new show, The Witcher, which is a large amount of people. So I posted something about why concurrent users is actually an ambiguous way to measure throughput, and I want to expound a little bit more on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;concurrent-users-in-performance-testing---limitations&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Concurrent users&amp;rdquo; in performance testing - limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In load testing, the number of concurrent users is a pretty standard measure of throughput, and generally, it means the number of users that are accessing an application at any one point in time. And even on Flood, we use it because it&amp;rsquo;s a really good rule of thumb. When we want to get a feel for how big a test is, load testers generally ask, &amp;ldquo;How many users?&amp;rdquo; However, we should be aware, as load testers, that that doesn&amp;rsquo;t always give us the full picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-type-of-user-is-it&#34;&gt;What type of user is it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the type of user that it is can really change the traffic. Sometimes mobile browsers will optimize requests so that they send fewer because they realize that mobile networks are slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-the-user-doing&#34;&gt;What is the user doing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, what is the user doing? Are they browsing on different tabs all the time? Or are they just refreshing the content on the same tab? Because if they&amp;rsquo;re just using the same page and fetching it over and over again, then caching could come into play, so that would create a different load on the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-long-is-the-user-doing-it&#34;&gt;How long is the user doing it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thirdly, how long is the user doing it? Are we talking about a sustained load for an hour, or is it a shorter time period, like a spike test of five minutes where all the users just ram a system? There are things like the number of requests per second that you need to take into account, which is affected by the think time and the delays that you set in your script. Perhaps your script has a user that just sends a request, then waits for a minute, and then sends another request. That&amp;rsquo;s very different from a user just sending one request after another as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-does-the-user-do-it&#34;&gt;When does the user do it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, it&amp;rsquo;s also important to take into account the seasonality of the request. When does the user do it? If you have a timesheeting application, for instance, then it might only get traffic on Fridays and a little bit on Monday, so you need to specify, when you report these numbers, whether it&amp;rsquo;s for the peak time period on Friday - you know, around 3 pm or something - or you&amp;rsquo;re reporting on figures from a Wednesday when there really wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be that many people accessing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Netflix, what they counted as a view was only a two-minute watch time. So if you&amp;rsquo;re one of those people who went into The Witcher and didn&amp;rsquo;t watch past two minutes, that still counted as a view. So the 76 million users is still not completely accurate, because not all of those people would have watched the entire thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concurrent users is a good way in order to get a quick feel of the throughput that a test outputs, but it really needs to be examined in context along with things like requests per second and the network throughput (kbps) in order to get a really good understanding of how much load a test is generating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ask a Flooder 07: What is the difference between performance testing and load testing?</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-07-what-is-the-difference-between-performance-testing-and-load-testing-video&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a two-for-one Ask a Flooder, I answer two questions: What is the difference between performance testing and load testing and in which situations is performance testing a better option than load testing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8CueAkDY5yE&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transcript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi again, it&amp;rsquo;s Nicole back for another Ask a Flooder. And this time, the question from one of our customers is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-difference-between-performance-testing-and-load-testing&#34;&gt;What is the difference between performance testing and load testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this is really a matter of semantics, and it kind of depends on whom you ask, but in general, performance is how quickly an application responds. So when you&amp;rsquo;re doing performance testing, you&amp;rsquo;re doing one of two things: there&amp;rsquo;s front-end performance, and then there&amp;rsquo;s back-end performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In front-end performance, you&amp;rsquo;re looking at things like how quickly does the application render for the customer on the client-side. It&amp;rsquo;s how fast something renders on the screen, so it&amp;rsquo;s how page resources can be rearranged or optimized so that the experience is a lot faster for the end customer. So the focus is on the client-side on the end user&amp;rsquo;s actual device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the back-end performance side, you&amp;rsquo;re looking at the server. How quickly does the server send a response to a request that&amp;rsquo;s sent by the browser?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So those are really two different things because back-end performance really looks at everything outside - everything beyond - the device of the customer. Both kinds of performance testing are important. A solid, holistic performance testing strategy will incorporate both front-end and back-end performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different types of back-end performance testing. You might have heard of load testing, stress testing, volume testing. At Flood, we kind of refer to all of those under the bracket of load testing. They do have some semantic differences between them, but in general, we talk about load testing to refer to simulating traffic against an application server to see how that server responds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the type of the testing that you want to do will also affect the kind of performance testing tool that you choose. For instance, a tool like Flood Element can do both front-end and back-end testing, but a tool like JMeter is only going to be useful for the back-end performance testing. So you need to choose your test according to the testing type that you&amp;rsquo;d like to carry out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This customer also had a follow-up question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-which-situations-is-performance-testing-a-better-option-than-load-testing&#34;&gt;In which situations is performance testing a better option than load testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one answer to this is when front-end performance is required. So if what you&amp;rsquo;re after is trying to speed up how quickly your application renders on a mobile device, for instance, you might be better off looking at tools like GTMetrix or WebPageTest in order to measure and improve that side of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really want to stress here that neither front-end performance nor back-end performance is better than the other. If you&amp;rsquo;re asking me which type of testing you should do, my answer would be both. Till next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ask a Flooder 06: How to record traffic from a mobile app with JMeter</title>

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-06-how-to-record-traffic-from-a-mobile-app-with-jmeter-video&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-06-how-to-record-traffic-from-a-mobile-app-with-jmeter-video&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you record the traffic from your native mobile app using Apache JMeter? In this video, I explain step-by-step how to begin load testing a native mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VVUyYF1VPlo&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might want to be doing this because you&amp;rsquo;re load testing a mobile app but either you don&amp;rsquo;t have access to your developers right now so they can&amp;rsquo;t help you with how the requests are made or what the requests are, or maybe you just want to verify what you&amp;rsquo;ve already been told. Either way, I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you how using my Android device (it&amp;rsquo;s a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+) and a Macbook Pro 13&amp;quot;. However, the same principles should apply to other mobile devices and laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-download-and-install-the-mobile-app&#34;&gt;Step 1: Download and install the mobile app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you&amp;rsquo;ll want to do is download and install the app. Now, if the app has already been released, then that&amp;rsquo;s no problem. You just go to the Google Play Store and download it. However, if it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been released yet and you&amp;rsquo;ve been given an APK file for the app, then you&amp;rsquo;ll have to tweak your settings a little bit in order to get your phone to allow you to download it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;m going to do this right with you. So go into Settings: pull down the little notification screen and hit the little gear icon, and you&amp;rsquo;ll see a bunch of settings there. Scroll down all the way to the bottom until you see About phone. Click that and then click Software Information. You&amp;rsquo;ll see the Build number halfway through the screen here&amp;ndash; and I know this is weird, but click on it seven times. You have to draw your pattern if you have one set up, but you&amp;rsquo;ll see here that it says Developer Mode has been enabled. That&amp;rsquo;s all you need to do; from now on you can install any APK, but be careful, because if you don&amp;rsquo;t trust the source, you know, they could do some damage to your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-2-set-up-the-https-test-script-recorder-on-jmeter&#34;&gt;Step 2: Set up the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder on JMeter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second step is setting up an HTTP recorder on JMeter. So let&amp;rsquo;s head over to our laptop. Make sure you&amp;rsquo;re connected to a wifi network. Now, this is a completely new JMeter test plan here. So just right-click on Test Plan and then hover over Add, and then you&amp;rsquo;re going to go down to Non-Test Elements. Select the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder. You&amp;rsquo;ll see here that the port it uses is 8888. We&amp;rsquo;ll need that for later. Now right-click on the Test Script Recorder, hit Add, and then Listener. We&amp;rsquo;ll add a View Results Tree to be able to capture the results that we need later. Now we&amp;rsquo;ll click on the Test Plan - right-click - and then we&amp;rsquo;re going to Add a Thread Group. Now let&amp;rsquo;s right-click on the Thread Group and go to Add &amp;gt; Logic Controller &amp;gt; Recording Controller. This is where the requests that we&amp;rsquo;re going to send are going to be recorded, and we&amp;rsquo;ll see both the requests and the responses in View Results Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-3-set-up-your-mobile-to-use-the-https-test-script-recorder-as-a-proxy&#34;&gt;Step 3: Set up your mobile to use the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder as a proxy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the third step is to set up your mobile to use a proxy. So, back on the mobile, go back to Settings and hit Connections. And then click on Wifi. Now verify that the wifi network that you&amp;rsquo;re connected to on your mobile is the same one as the wifi network that you&amp;rsquo;re connected to on your laptop. If it&amp;rsquo;s the same, click the gear icon. And then hit Advanced all the way at the bottom. Now the Proxy settings are on the second option here so hit the down menu here and then hit Manual. Now, for the Proxy host name we&amp;rsquo;ll have to go back to the computer to see what our local IP address is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in order to do that, you just have to go to System Preferences. I&amp;rsquo;m doing it from the Apple menu here and from System Preferences, click on Network. And once you&amp;rsquo;ve selected the wifi network, hit Advanced, and then TCP/IP. So what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for will be this IPv4 Address. Now you&amp;rsquo;re going to type that into the Host name field on your mobile. So let me just type that in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll note that this is actually a local IP address. It&amp;rsquo;s not your public IP address. Now for our proxy port, we&amp;rsquo;ll go and look at the laptop to see the Test Script Recorder Settings and it was 8888, so that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re going to put in here. All right. And then click on Save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-4-start-recording&#34;&gt;Step 4: Start recording&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 4 is recording the traffic. Now, go back to your laptop on JMeter and click on the Test Script Recorder. Now we&amp;rsquo;re going to click on Start. It&amp;rsquo;ll come up with this popup box here and you can just click OK since we already trust the source. You&amp;rsquo;ll see this little popup here to confirm that we are recording traffic. Now let&amp;rsquo;s see if we&amp;rsquo;ve actually configured it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our mobiles, let&amp;rsquo;s go back and open the app that you want to use. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to be using the IowaReporterApp. I just did an article on this on The New Stack (link in the description below) about how I would load test the Iowa Caucus Reporter App. So that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m going to be using for this tutorial as well. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to open that (&amp;ldquo;getting ready to caucus&amp;rdquo;) and I don&amp;rsquo;t have a valid precinct ID so I&amp;rsquo;m just going to put flood.io and I&amp;rsquo;m going to click Login. So it&amp;rsquo;s telling me that the connection isn&amp;rsquo;t private. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually expect this to work, because the app has been taken down and I don&amp;rsquo;t have valid login credentials, but I&amp;rsquo;m still just going to go forward. So, Proceed. You might have to do this as well if your certificates haven&amp;rsquo;t been set up correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so now we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten this error here and it says, &amp;ldquo;Oops, something went wrong&amp;rdquo;. So it&amp;rsquo;s handy to know what it looks like on your mobile so that you can go into JMeter and see if that&amp;rsquo;s what you see as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on JMeter let&amp;rsquo;s go to the View Results Tree and it looks like Google Play tried to do a few things beforehand but what we&amp;rsquo;re really looking for is this IDP caucus thing. So, these are the requests that my phone made and these are the responses. So this is where we got the certificate error because it says &amp;ldquo;certificate unknown&amp;rdquo;. Now this is the actual request we sent for login. You can see the request here - the full request - and also the full response. Now, just to check we&amp;rsquo;ll make sure we got the same response in the body here on JMeter that we saw on our mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here it is; it says &amp;ldquo;Oops!, something went wrong&amp;rdquo;. You can of course just search for this. So we&amp;rsquo;ll stop the recording now because we&amp;rsquo;ve confirmed that we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten what we wanted. So in the recording controller, we can see the requests that were recorded from our mobile app and the first one looks like it was one to Google so that&amp;rsquo;s not one we want. If we were doing this again, we could actually go into the Test Script Recorder, go into this Requests Filtering tab, and we could just filter out or exclude the domains that we don&amp;rsquo;t want to test, like Google. But this looks like the request that we were actually looking for. You&amp;rsquo;ll see the full request here with all the parameters and the values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s how you record traffic from a native mobile app on JMeter. From here, you can then play around with the request. Like we saw, there were a lot of dynamic values that were recorded in the request. We would probably want to correlate those and make sure that we&amp;rsquo;re doing those correctly. But this is a really great starting point for testing a mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till the next Ask a Flooder, happy Flooding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-05-how-do-i-get-started-with-flood-element-video&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-05-how-do-i-get-started-with-flood-element-video&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this Ask a Flooder, I talk about getting started with Flood Element. Element is an open-source tool that is a good Selenium alternative for browser-based load testing. It runs Puppeteer under the hood to drive real browsers at scale and can be paired with Flood for cloud load testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWtnStKrh98&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TRANSCRIPT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re sold on browser-based load testing and want to get started on Element, I think the easiest way to do that is by going to &lt;a href=&#34;http://element.flood.io&#34;&gt;element.flood.io&lt;/a&gt; and clicking on Install on the upper left corner. You can follow those instructions to get started, and you can also click on the links on the left side if you get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Element is installed, open up the directory and look at the examples folder. There you&amp;rsquo;ll find a lot of sample scripts that we&amp;rsquo;ve already made up for you. The easiest way to get started is to just modify some of these slightly so that you&amp;rsquo;re testing your site. For example, you could just change the URL and step names to make it appropriate for what you&amp;rsquo;re testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you can run it locally using the command element run the name of your test script, like test.ts,  and then I also like to include the no-headless flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;element run test.ts --no-headless&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The no-headless flag is going to run a real browser, a Chromium browser, on your machine, so that you can see what the script is actually doing. This is a great way to debug and troubleshoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;re ready to run your load test on the cloud, you can simply drag and drop your Element script into the Flood stream editor and then start your load test as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the links in the description below for more information about Element, how to get started, and how to run an Element script on Flood.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ask a Flooder 04: Why would your load testing tool report higher response times than you expect?</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20200311-aaf04/</link>

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/why-would-your-load-testing-tool-report-higher-response-times-than-you-expect-video&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/why-would-your-load-testing-tool-report-higher-response-times-than-you-expect-video&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this Ask a Flooder, I tackle a question we get all the time from users regarding results, particularly for cloud load testing. Sometimes you might notice that response times that are reported in by your load testing tool do not match up with the response time you see from your own browser. What causes this, and how can we fix it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/goKK2aACZZY&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transcript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s always confusing when your load testing tool reports higher average response times than what you can see while you&amp;rsquo;re manually accessing your application on your browser. There are many things that might cause this, but one of the most common causes for it is that you&amp;rsquo;re overloading your node generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general rule of thumb, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to keep your CPU utilization at 80% or less throughout the duration of the test. It is normal for it to spike in the beginning, but it should ideally come to a more stable spot below 80%. If your node&amp;rsquo;s CPU utilization is going over 80% for most of the test, then what that means is that your node is struggling to get those requests out, which may lead to some inaccurate results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can confirm whether or not this is the cause of your high response times by checking the logs and checking the resource utilization on your nodes.If you&amp;rsquo;re running on Flood, you can do this while the flood is running by going over to Grids, selecting the grid, and then scrolling down on the panel on the right to see the CPU and memory as well as the network throughput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of things you can do to fix this. The first one is to increase any sort of delays or think times in your script — and, if you don&amp;rsquo;t already have any, you should add some. Think times make the script a lot more realistic and a lot closer to what real users would do. If these values are too low, then your load testing tool is just going to run the script as fast as possible, consuming more resources than necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing you can do is reduce the number of users you&amp;rsquo;re running per node. This will free up more resources per node and make it a lot easier to scale up your load tests more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/results-analysis/troubleshooting-results-analysis/reported-response-times-higher-than-observed&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; for more detailed information on resource over-utilization and other possible reasons for differences between response times in a test and on a browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/dismantling-cognitive-biases-in-performance-testing&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/dismantling-cognitive-biases-in-performance-testing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers and testers alike prefer to think of themselves as entirely rational beings, because both software development and software testing do require systematic rigor and logical reasoning. However, the reality is that the human element still comes into play when building and testing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://testconf.ru/2019/en/nicole-van-der-hoeven/index.html&#34;&gt;this year’s TestCon conference&lt;/a&gt;, held in Moscow, Russia, I delivered a talk on how cognitive biases affect web performance outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the talk, I discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;two types of thinking: fast thinking and slow thinking (from Daniel Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555&#34;&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how to influence the sentence duration that judges give perpetrators&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what cognitive biases are and how they can affect performance testing results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a real-life production incident that occurred on Flood and how our team&amp;rsquo;s cognitive biases got in the way of its resolution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what to do to avoid cognitive biases when testing software&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the video of my full talk:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
