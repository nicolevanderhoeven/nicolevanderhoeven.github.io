  <meta name="description" content="Hi, I&#39;m Nicole van der Hoeven. I&#39;m a Developer Advocate at k6.io. I&#39;ve spent my career making software faster as a load tester. I&#39;m a proud polynational (Filipino, Australian, and Dutch), polyglot (currently learning TL, EN, NL, ES, EO, DE, FR), and polymath. I publicly learn cool things I have no business learning, then share what I&#39;ve learned. I write technical and fictional articles and books, film and produce videos, create podcasts, speak at conferences, and otherwise just generally enjoy getting to know people. This site is a home for everything I&#39;m doing on the interwebs, but my real-life home these days is Maastricht, in the Netherlands.">

<p><em>(remote)</em></p>
<p>I joined <a href="https://k6.io">k6.io</a> in November 2020 as a Developer Advocate, specializing in Performance Testing. k6 is a <a href="https://github.com/loadimpact/k6">free and open source tool</a> for load testing, with the goal of making the process as developer-friendly as possible. The company also has a related SaaS platform, <a href="https://k6.io/cloud">k6 Cloud</a>, which is an easy way to scale up load tests on the cloud.</p>
<p>I make a lot of content on the k6 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/k6test">YouTube</a> channel, starting with my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJdv3RhAQXNHsC8OOV3ZjwZvC9tRoAYF2">Week of Testing</a> videos that I made in my real first week to document how I learned the k6 ecosystem. I co-host a weekly livestream I thought up, called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-NtzkxdzyA&amp;list=PLJdv3RhAQXNE1TFXn2pp9h_Ul1q_kJrEZ">k6 Office Hours</a>, where we talk about different ways to use k6 to improve application performance. I speak at <a href="/speaking">conferences</a>, engage with the community, and generally try out new things and tell people how cool k6 is.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tricentis.com">Tricentis</a> <a href="https://flood.io">Flood</a> is a SaaS load testing platform for running load testing scripts of leading open source tools. I had a very mixed role where I created written, video, and audio content on load testing and how to use Flood, gave presentations at conferences, managed social media accounts and the company blog, responded to customer support queries, and coached clients all over the world on how to use load testing to improve software quality. I really enjoyed working for a small, closely-knit team and being able to jump into different roles at the drop of a hat. I also got to write a book on API load testing.</p>

<p><em>Heerlen, the Netherlands</em></p>
<p>I worked at <a href="https://apg.nl/">APG</a>, a large pension provider in the Netherlands, as a performance testing consultant. I was able to help several projects identify performance issues before go-live and set up a stubbing tool to virtualise key components that interfered with testing. I also worked on a test strategy for load testing a blockchain. All communication was in Dutch.</p>

<p><em>Melbourne, Australia</em></p>
<p>I was part of the closely-knit performance testing team that carried out load and resilience testing for <a href="https://tabcorp.com.au">Tabcorp</a>, the largest gaming corporation in Australia, including preparation for the world-famous Melbourne Cup racing carnival. This was a massive and exciting undertaking, with multiple traffic channels and applications that needed to be tested.</p>

<p><em>Melbourne and Sydney, Australia</em></p>
<p><a href="https://planittesting.com">Planit</a> is a multinational professional services consultancy. I worked as a technical testing consultant to set up performance testing frameworks, formulate test strategies, and execute load testing for companies in a variety of industries. Consulting is a frenzied period of rapid-pace learning, and I actually relished the new challenges that came with every new project.</p>

<h3 id="test-analyst">Test Analyst</h3>
<p><em>Melbourne, Australia</em></p>
<p>This was my first official job as a tester for <a href="https://www.accesshq.com/">Access HQ</a>, a testing consultancy company. I was lucky enough to find a mentor and get a headstart in performance testing right away. As a testing consultant, I helped teams write realistic load tests and analyze the results. I also crossed over into functional testing for a time, appreciating the need for more rigid testing practices at some projects.</p>

<p><em>Melbourne, Australia</em></p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.jetstar.com/">Jetstar</a>, the low-cost branch of the national airline, I analyzed aircraft engine component records to determine maintenance schedules.

<p>I joined EnergyOpt right out of university.

I employed econometric techniques to set prices and improve the software&rsquo;s responsiveness to market demand.</p>
