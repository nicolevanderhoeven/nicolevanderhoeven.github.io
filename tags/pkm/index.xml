      <description>&lt;p&gt;Visual atomic note taking in Obsidian can be a great complement to taking notes in text form if you use tools like the Obsidian Excalidraw plugin. Obsidian Excalidraw lets you link and backlink with images, tag them for querying later, and even embed images AND parts of images. It&amp;rsquo;s an essential part of taking notes visually while not missing out on the benefits of plain text.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reading and Taking Notes on Kindle and Obsidian</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Reading on a Kindle can be more convenient than reading paperbacks because you can import your Kindle highlights and notes into Obsidian or your note-taking app of choice. Here are some tips for making the most out of every book you read.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Obsidian Canvas Core Plugin (new in v1.0.0)</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20221209-obsidian-canvas-core-plugin/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20221209-obsidian-canvas-core-plugin/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The new Obsidian Canvas core plugin was introduced recently in v1.1.0, currently available only to Insiders but soon available to everyone. Canvas is an optional plugin that gives Obsidian an infinitely scrolling space to arrange notes, media, and other cards (potentially including external websites). If you&amp;rsquo;ve heard of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.scrintal.com/&#34;&gt;Scrintal&lt;/a&gt;, this core plugin brings some of the same visual thinking workflows to Obsidian, which I think is a very smart step.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How do you go about making notes actually useful? Using notes well entails taking good notes in the first place, processing them, and then creating something new out of them. In this video, I talk about the plugins that I use in every stage of the process, and some guidelines for how I actually make a note on something I&amp;rsquo;ve learned into content that I (and others) can make use of.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Notion-like Content Calendar in Obsidian Projects</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20221118-notion-like-content-calendar-in-obsidian-projects/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20221118-notion-like-content-calendar-in-obsidian-projects/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re looking to create a content calendar in Obsidian just like in Notion, the new Obsidian Projects plugin presents new options for managing content using multiple views: Table, Board, Calendar, and Gallery to start with, but hopefully more in the future. Projects is a framework for creating new views for the same data and aims to play well with other plugins.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Many Obsidian Vaults Should You Have?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The more notes you have, the more you might wonder if you should have multiple vaults in Obsidian. There is no definitive answer, but in this video, I talk about reasons you should have only one vault as well as good reasons to have several vaults, based on my own experience. Like with anything I say, take what&amp;rsquo;s useful and do what makes sense!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wanted rotating Notion database views in Obsidian? Marcus Olsson&amp;rsquo;s Obsidian Projects plugin does exactly that, letting you create Table, Board, Calendar, and Gallery views for the same notes in Obsidian, just like in Notion! Join us as Marcus shows us how this awesome new plugin works and how it can be used to display the same data in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Organize Your Notes in Obsidian</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wondering how to organize your notes in Obsidian? In this video, I talk about some methods in Obsidian for imposing structure and organization, the LATCH method for adding data to your data, and which methods I would use in Obsidian for each part of LATCH (Location, Alphabet, Time, Category, and Hierarchy). This is not meant to be a definitive or prescriptive guide for how YOU should organize your notes. Instead, take this as a look into how I prefer to do it, in the hopes that you may find inspiration for how you&amp;rsquo;d like to do it as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taking Better Notes From Books: Shortform-Readwise-Obsidian</title>

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JfL9iAEfSCg&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using &lt;a href=&#34;https://shortform.com/nicole&#34;&gt;Shortform&lt;/a&gt; for over a year. I&amp;rsquo;ve written &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/shortform-to-readwise&#34;&gt;some code&lt;/a&gt; for it and I&amp;rsquo;ve also written &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210815-shortform-to-readwise/&#34;&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; about it. It&amp;rsquo;s an essential part of my workflow for taking better notes from books, particularly in conjunction with &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/nicole&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt; and my current note-taking tool of choice, &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md/&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;rsquo;s what you need to know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-shortform&#34;&gt;What is Shortform?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortform is a service that creates book summaries out of popular books, but it&amp;rsquo;s also so much more than that! They&amp;rsquo;re like Netflix but for books, if you can imagine that. The summaries that Shortform gives you are not just your typical high school level summaries of a book report that we used to do when we were younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-makes-shortform-different&#34;&gt;What makes Shortform different?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are things that differentiate Shortform from other book summary services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;researched-commentary&#34;&gt;Researched commentary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortform has really thoughtful and nuanced commentary that place it firmly head and shoulders above other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot of some Shortform commentary from the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3gO0gmP&#34;&gt;Why We Sleep&lt;/a&gt;, taken on the Shortform mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/shortform-why-we-sleep.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Shortform commentary from the book &amp;amp;ldquo;Why We Sleep&amp;amp;rdquo;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlighted section is a Shortform note&amp;ndash; additional commentary that the Shortform team added. In this case, they are fact-checking the author, citing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sleep.pitt.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/The-AASM-Manual-for-Scoring-of-Sleep-and-Associated-Events-2007-.pdf&#34;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; that prove a statement the author made to be false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was reading this book, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really think about questioning those claims. But Shortform thoroughly goes over every claim that Walker, the author, made in thsi book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading with Shortform is like having somebody else read a book with you&amp;ndash; a more critical and more well-informed someone who has the time to fact-check statements. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like having your own personal book club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;shortform-vs-blinkist&#34;&gt;Shortform vs. Blinkist&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another service in this vein that I&amp;rsquo;ve used is &lt;a href=&#34;https://blinkist.com/&#34;&gt;Blinkist&lt;/a&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the same book in Shortform and Blinkist to figure out why I like Shortform so much better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what the Blinkist summary for the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3W8rFQH&#34;&gt;Indistractable&lt;/a&gt; looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/blinkist-indistractable-summary.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Blinkist summary of Indistractable&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blinkist is based on the idea that every book can be distilled into these &lt;em&gt;blinks&lt;/em&gt;: very short summaries of every idea. For this book it has eight. Each of these blinks is a few paragraphs long. Here&amp;rsquo;s what the first looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/blinkist-indistractable-first-section.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Blinkist&amp;amp;rsquo;s Indistractable blink&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blink is a straight summary. There&amp;rsquo;s no commentary. There&amp;rsquo;s no research or anything like that. It seems like the whole focus of this is to be able to distill exactly what the author has said and let other people do the work of trying to figure out for themselves whether something is true or not. There&amp;rsquo;s really not much more than just these blinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, if we look at the one on Shortform, this is the same book and it also has like a one page summary like Blinkist did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/shortform-indistractable-summary.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Shortform summary of Indistractable&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then it also has a full book guide, which goes through every single chapter or part and adds more detail into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/shortform-indistractable-first-section.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Shorform&amp;amp;rsquo;s Indistractable first part&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, Shortform takes a different approach: instead of just summarizing the book, they&amp;rsquo;re truly trying to explain it in their own unique way, providing examples and making it more readable using bullet points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;action-oriented-exercises&#34;&gt;Action-oriented exercises&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortform also has these exercises based on the things that the author has said in the book. These exercises are peppered throughout and between these chapters, and they really force you to put things into practice right away as soon as you learn them, which is another element of learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/shortform-indistractable-exercises.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of an exercise in Shortform&amp;amp;rsquo;s Indistractable summary&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;critical-thinking-comparisons-to-other-ideas&#34;&gt;Critical thinking: comparisons to other ideas&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortform tries to examine ideas in the context of other books they&amp;rsquo;ve made summaries for. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of a Shortform note where Shortform suggests the summary of the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3NdqE5C&#34;&gt;How to Stop Worrying and Start Living&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/shortform-indistractable-comparison.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Screenshot of Shortform note connecting Indistractable to another book&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fans of the Zettelkasten method will be happy to see this, because Shortform often prompts me to consider the differences or similarities between ideas from different authors. It helps me see connections I might not have considered. Incidentally, I&amp;rsquo;ve also found many good books this way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-use-shortform-with-obsidian&#34;&gt;How to use Shortform with Obsidian&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other thing that really sells it for me is the integration. Because I don&amp;rsquo;t want that learning to stop in the Shortform app. You know me, and I want everything in Obsidian. And Shortform has an integration that Blinkist does not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually tried to solve this problem myself a year ago, because no integration existed. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210815-shortform-to-readwise/&#34;&gt;wrote a Python script&lt;/a&gt; that would take the Shortform highlights, because it has an API, and then call the Readwise API and kind of string them together. Now, that still works as far as I know, but that&amp;rsquo;s not what I recommend anymore. I talked to the Readwise founders and suggested to them that Shortform was a great company to partner with. Not too long after that, they came out with &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/changelog/shortform-import&#34;&gt;an awesome integration&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, sign up to both &lt;a href=&#34;https://shortform.com/nicole&#34;&gt;Shortform&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/nicole&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt;. They both have free trials, so you don&amp;rsquo;t have to commit to anything just yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/welcome/sync#shortform&#34;&gt;click on this link to connect&lt;/a&gt; your Readwise account to Shortform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;(optional) If you use Obsidian like I do, &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210810-readwise-to-obsidian-redux/&#34;&gt;follow these instructions&lt;/a&gt; to install the Readwise Official plugin for Obsidian.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s pretty much it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on, here&amp;rsquo;s how things will work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You make highlights on books on Shortform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those highlights are sent to Readwise automatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Through the Readwise official plugin, those highlights get synced into your Obsidian vault.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-result-shortform-highlights-in-obsidian&#34;&gt;The result: Shortform highlights in Obsidian&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what my Shortform highlights look like in Obsidian. Note that after setting this up, all I had to do was make highlights on Shortform&amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s quite low-touch after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-shortform-indistractable.png&#34; alt=&#34;Shorform highlights synced to Obsidian vault via Readwise&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tweaked the export settings in Readwise to set the format I want the note to have in Obsidian. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to do this, but if you want to, you can change those settings &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/export/obsidian/preferences&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-shortform-workflow-for-taking-notes-on-books&#34;&gt;My Shortform workflow for taking notes on books&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is pretty much how a lot of my book-buying and -reading goes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I start by browsing books on Shortform and read the one-page summaries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I find one I like, I buy the book on Kindle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I make highlights on the Kindle version. (Those are synced to Obsidian too!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I really like the book, I flip back to the Shortform detailed chapter summaries as I finish each chapter, because they provide more context. I make highlights and notes from Shortform here sometimes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes I do the Shortform exercises too.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After I finish the book, I go back to the Shortform summary and make more highlights/notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After I&amp;rsquo;ve read my fill of both the Shortform summary and the book itself, I go back to Obsidian and write my own notes that combine what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that sounds like a lot, it is! But keep in mind that I don&amp;rsquo;t do this for &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; book. At every step of the way, Shortform helps me filter out books that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to read, or don&amp;rsquo;t want to finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortform definitely saves me money: it costs less than a book a month and it stops me from reading more than one book a month. From that perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s already worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more than that, the thoughtfulness of the summaries and the research that goes into those commentaries save me more than just money: &lt;em&gt;they save me time&lt;/em&gt;. And that&amp;rsquo;s really what I keep coming back for.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this real use case for Obsidian, I use plugins like Dataview, Database Folder, QuickAdd, Templater, and Buttons to create a database in Obsidian to track Kickstarter projects I&amp;rsquo;ve backed. I show two approaches to creating a database and demonstrate a relatively new plugin, Database Folder, which shows a lot of promise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I demonstrate how I learn Swedish in 30 days using Obsidian and other apps. Learning foreign languages is never easy, but having a system in place definitely makes the process easier. The Obsidian Spaced Repetition plugin in particular helps create flashcards that I can use on my laptop or mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Readwise Reader is the latest read-it-later app, except not just for books. Reader brings in your highlights from books, articles, tweets, PDFs, epubs, emails, and even newsletters! While it&amp;rsquo;s not yet officially launched, it&amp;rsquo;s now in public beta and you can sign up to be put on a wait list to try out this awesome product that&amp;rsquo;s been so essential to my workflows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note: I do have an affiliate link of &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/nicole&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt;, but this video was not sponsored. They know I&amp;rsquo;m making this video, because I had to reach out to get permission to post the screenshot of a private email, but they did not review this video and had no idea what I was going to say. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I demonstrate how to take notes from a book (The Culture Map) using Obsidian. In the process of taking notes, I also create learning exhaust in the form of notes, an atomic essay to go on Twitter, a visual that summarises a concept, and a video presentation. Taking notes from books is more than just understanding what the author wanted to say; it should also involve consolidation and interrogation of the book&amp;rsquo;s ideas into our personal knowledge management systems.&lt;/p&gt;

I also talk about how I study in Obsidian: the courses, platforms, and apps I use&amp;ndash; and how I make sense of it all using Obsidian. Studying isn&amp;rsquo;t just for students. as a professional, I am also constantly learning. To make sure I make the most of the costs of education, I&amp;rsquo;ve made a deal with myself to commit to processing everything in Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I demonstrate how to make your notes visual with visual PKM plugins like Excalidraw, Excalibrain, Advanced Slides, and Mind Map. Adding visual elements to your notes, whether through distinguishing text or adding images and video, helps make notes more meaningful to you, increasing understanding and retention.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know you can create a visual map of content in Obsidian to consolidate your notes? The Excalidraw plugin by Zsolt Viczian can be used to create a dashboard in Obsidian, take sketchnotes instead of text notes, express your ideas visually, and many more. Maps of content are useful for bottom-up thinking, and having a visual representation of your notes can inspire you to consider other perspectives or communicate your ideas in a clearer way.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a glaring gap in most productivity systems: time. How do REAL people, with real jobs and obligations, find the time to process notes? Is Inbox Zero an achievable and sustainable goal? I think the answer is no. In this video, I talk about what to do instead, and what is a healthier way to look at productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Getting Things Done methodology is showing its age now, but there are still some parts of it that can be updated and used in the digital age. In this video, I talk about how to actually get things done with Obsidian using the Obsidian community plugin called Checklist.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever wanted to use Obsidian for managing your tasks? In this video, I demonstrate one way to consolidate tasks from all your notes and show them on the date they&amp;rsquo;re due, using DataviewJS. Obsidian Dataview is a community plugin that can be used to show a task list.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What even IS Obsidian Dataview? Dataview has quickly become one of the most popular plugins for Obsidian, but how do you actually use it? Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a non-programmer or an expert coder, here&amp;rsquo;s how to use the Obsidian Dataview plugin and some common use cases for it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Notion vs Obsidian - Databases vs Dataview</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Notion and Obsidian are similar in many ways, but they have a fundamental difference in philosophy and the way they structure notes. In this video, I talk about structure as well as Notion databases vs. Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s Dataview plugin, and tell you why I ultimately ended up with Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New in Obsidian: Obsidian Callouts (available now)</title>

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TqYQ0kA1yAo&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transcript:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from writing technical documentation in the last few years is that good writing is skimmable, at least in the digital age. So since I look at my notes in Obsidian the same way as I do a sort of personal documentation, I think that a lot of the same principles apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I wanna talk about an early access feature that the Obsidian team rolled out two weeks ago, and it&amp;rsquo;s called Callouts. So before I demonstrate this, I want to say that this is only available right now in the Insider Build version 0.14, but that build always gets pushed to the public, it&amp;rsquo;s just a little bit ahead of the public release. So think of this as a bit of a sneak preview. &lt;em&gt;(Note: Obsidian callouts is &lt;a href=&#34;https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Use+callouts&#34;&gt;out now&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-obsidian-admonition&#34;&gt;What about Obsidian Admonition?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before Obsidian Callouts was released, I was using something called Obsidian Admonition. So if we go here, I can bring up my Obsidian Admonition page, and it looked something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would do three backticks. That&amp;rsquo;s kind of the code block syntax. And you would do something like add note. Maybe you&amp;rsquo;d have a title here, like reminder, and then you&amp;rsquo;d have your note here. And because I have Live Preview turned on, if I enter out of this, it&amp;rsquo;s going to look like this. So this is what Obsidian Admonition always looked like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in general, the idea here is that to make your writing more skimmable, you have these kind of, well, callout boxes that highlight sections of your text and make sure that they address something that is about the notes that you&amp;rsquo;re writing, kind of like meta notes, they&amp;rsquo;re notes about your notes, but because they&amp;rsquo;re visually distinguished from the rest of the text, it&amp;rsquo;s a lot easier for you or for your readers to easily figure out whether something is important to read or only in specific situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;admonitioncallout-example&#34;&gt;Admonition/callout example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that happens a lot in technical documentation, so it&amp;rsquo;s no secret that I have used it a lot in sort of programming kind of notes. So if we go back to my vault here, let&amp;rsquo;s look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/g&#34;&gt;my note on g&lt;/a&gt;. g is a package manager for Go, the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s a type of callout or admonition that I used. And this is kind of like this page tells you how to use, what g is and how to use it. But this note, this particular callout, is kind of like an aside. It&amp;rsquo;s like, hey, just in case you get this error, here&amp;rsquo;s how to troubleshoot it. And it&amp;rsquo;s really cool that it&amp;rsquo;s hidden by, it&amp;rsquo;s collapsed by default. And you can just click on that, and then it says, oh, if you get the error, g not found, hey, maybe restart your shell session after installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that sort of callout really helps when you&amp;rsquo;re trying to quickly skim a page. So programming is certainly one use for it, and another one is tutorials in general. You know, I have this a lot for my Obsidian stuff in case I need to say that this only works for Mac or this only works for windows or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I also use it a lot in my D&amp;amp;D games. As a Dungeon Master, I have different scenarios that I may not even need to go into depending on what my players decide to do. That is the perfect task for callouts or for admonitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enter-obsidian-callouts&#34;&gt;Enter Obsidian Callouts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I was using this admonitions format with a code block for, basically, since I learned about it. It is made by a TTRPG plugin developer called Jeremy Valentine, and he&amp;rsquo;s made a lot of very popular ones, like the Dice Roller and the Initiative Tracker and Leaflet, and it just goes on and on. But I&amp;rsquo;m digressing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plugin was apparently so good that even the Obsidian team realized that it really should be part of Obsidian, because a key part of Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s functionality is documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the big release is that they&amp;rsquo;ve now incorporated Admonitions-like functionality into core Obsidian, not a core plugin, so it&amp;rsquo;s not something that you even have to install or enable, it just ships by default with Obsidian, which is really awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-use-obsidian-callouts&#34;&gt;How to use Obsidian Callouts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s look into how to use it. I&amp;rsquo;m going to go to my Obsidian Callouts page here. And the syntax is a little bit different from the admonitions one. Instead of the code blocks with the three backticks, this callouts functionality now uses blockquotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-markdown&#34; data-lang=&#34;markdown&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;[!info] Your title
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;The contents of your note here
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you do a single blockquote like an arrow, and then you do brackets, and then an exclamation point. And then there are a bunch of different types, which we&amp;rsquo;ll get into, but the most common one, I guess, is note. Then you would put your title here, and then you can put the rest of the note here. So this is now doing it as a blockquote. And if I exit out of that, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that it has a nice icon of a kinda pencil or pen there, and it is visually distinguished from the rest of the note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;types-of-callouts&#34;&gt;Types of Callouts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;note&#34;&gt;note&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;rsquo;s go into the types, &amp;lsquo;cause there are a few of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first one I already showed you, this is a note. I put this within code blocks just to show you the syntax. And then this is what it looks like. Basically, this is the standard format of callouts, you just change whatever&amp;rsquo;s here. And then you always put the title outside of the brackets, and then the content of the note below it. So this is what a note looks like. That&amp;rsquo;s probably the most common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract-summary-tldr&#34;&gt;abstract, summary, tldr&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then another one is abstract, summary, or TLDR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, all of these are the same, so like this is a TLDR, so I can actually edit it here as well. So here in this case, I was using TLDR, but if I do abstract, it&amp;rsquo;s going to look, actually, it looks a little bit different now that I think about it I thought it was going to look the same, but it&amp;rsquo;s also dependent on the theme that you&amp;rsquo;re using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so these three are actually different, even though they&amp;rsquo;re semantically the same. Well, that&amp;rsquo;s interesting. I just literally found that out right now as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;info-todo&#34;&gt;info, todo&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s info and todo. So this I believe is the todo. And if I go to info, it looks slightly different, just has a little eye here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I use for descriptions. What we call it in TTRPG is what we call box text, when players enter a new scene and there&amp;rsquo;s a part that you read out word for word, rather than improvising it. This is what I use for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tip-hint-important&#34;&gt;tip, hint, important&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you have tips, hint, tip, hint, or important. This one is a tip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see what important looks like. All right. Yeah, all right. So there&amp;rsquo;s some highlighting going on there as well, and it&amp;rsquo;s marked by an asterisk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;success-check-done&#34;&gt;success, check, done&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s success, check, done. I particularly like, I think it was done. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of like the todo had a checkbox. This one actually has the check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;questions-help-faq&#34;&gt;questions, help, faq&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s questions, help, or faq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;warning-caution-attention&#34;&gt;warning, caution, attention&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s warning, caution, or attention, which is what I use for errors or gotchas when you&amp;rsquo;re programming or something things that you might fall into that I want to call out, because I did fall into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fail-failure-missing&#34;&gt;fail, failure, missing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s also fail, failure, and missing. So this is all bad stuff, essentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;danger-error&#34;&gt;danger, error&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s danger, error. It looks like this with a little lightning symbol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bug&#34;&gt;bug&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s bug, which I use quite a bit when I&amp;rsquo;m reporting bugs or documenting bugs, anyway. This example, which kind of looks like abstract, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;quote-cite&#34;&gt;quote, cite&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quote, and cite, which is kind of a blockquote, except a little bit fancier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;collapsing-and-expanding-callouts&#34;&gt;Collapsing and expanding callouts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as you can see, there are a lot of different types of callouts. And aside from all of those, you can also choose whether it&amp;rsquo;s collapsed or expanded, and that&amp;rsquo;s kind of the folding behavior that I showed you earlier. So let&amp;rsquo;s just do that now as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to say bug, and I&amp;rsquo;ll say bug detected, let&amp;rsquo;s say. And this time though, where just before the title, right outside of the parenthesis for the type that I&amp;rsquo;m using, I&amp;rsquo;m going to type a minus. And I&amp;rsquo;ll put, this is a bug. And I get out of that. This is what it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it is very different from this one where it&amp;rsquo;s just expanded by default, that&amp;rsquo;s a default behavior, but if you add the minus there, that means that you&amp;rsquo;re saying that this must be minimized or collapsed by default. So then you can always click on that, and look, you see what was in the text there. You can also specify that it&amp;rsquo;s always expanded by default, but it already is always expanded by default, so you don&amp;rsquo;t really have to set that, unless you&amp;rsquo;ve changed the settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;benefits-of-obsidian-callouts&#34;&gt;Benefits of Obsidian Callouts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;better-documentation&#34;&gt;Better documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is a really cool and easy way of having these different colors. I know a lot of people that have come from Notion are kind of missing some of that in Obsidian. Well, this is an easy way to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ability-to-modify-callouts&#34;&gt;Ability to modify callouts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you can also change how it looks by modifying either the CSS of the theme or by selecting themes that just really use it and display it to its advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This theme here that I&amp;rsquo;m using is, let me check that, because I&amp;rsquo;m sure that people will ask. This is one of the gems of the year, one of the themes that won, it&amp;rsquo;s called Primary. Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s really cool, and it&amp;rsquo;s on the light setting. This is a test vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;callouts-are-native-on-obsidian-publish&#34;&gt;Callouts are native on Obsidian Publish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one of the coolest things about this new callouts feature is that it now works natively on Obsidian Publish. So I use Obsidian Publish for my public Obsidian vault, that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Obsidian+Callouts&#34;&gt;notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;rsquo;ll be a link in the description if you want to see what that looks like. It&amp;rsquo;s basically my way of learning in public. And I select different notes to publish on there for people to see, for anybody to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for a long time, admonitions, because it&amp;rsquo;s a plugin, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t show up up there. And then there was a way to do it where you can change the CSS and then kind of do it that way, but now that callouts is in core Obsidian, you don&amp;rsquo;t even have to do that. It&amp;rsquo;s just going to work right out of the box. So all of your notes that have the Obsidian callout syntax on them will show up the same way in your Obsidian Publish site, which is really awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-did-the-format-change-from-admonition-to-callouts&#34;&gt;Why did the format change from Admonition to callouts?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you might think, this is really just a format change, right? From admonition to callout, and part of it is that. I asked about why they changed the format, and the answer was that having the blockquote format falls back to blockquotes in unsupported Markdown renderer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;new-format-works-better-even-if-callouts-arent-supported&#34;&gt;New format works better even if callouts aren&amp;rsquo;t supported&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So for example, if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this note in an ID and IDE that doesn&amp;rsquo;t support that syntax, it&amp;rsquo;s at least still just going to look like a blockquote, which does make more sense than it looking like a code block, because you might not have code there. This is not just for code, this is for any sort of like sticky note that you wanna put on your notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;markdown-inside-blockquotes-gets-parsed&#34;&gt;Markdown inside blockquotes gets parsed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also because it just uses blockquotes, this means that all of the Markdown inside it also gets parsed, including links and embeds and even Dataview queries apparently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that also means that spellcheck can check it. Because if you put something in a code block, that&amp;rsquo;s kind of a signal for spellchecks not to have a look at the contents of that code block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;does-this-completely-replace-obsidian-admonition&#34;&gt;Does this completely replace Obsidian Admonition?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what happens with admonition? Because it&amp;rsquo;s been around for a while, it&amp;rsquo;s actually still up. And in fact, admonition-style code blocks will continue to work. They&amp;rsquo;re now supporting, Obsidian is now supporting both the callouts and admonition if you have admonition plugin still enabled, then you&amp;rsquo;re still going to be able to use both. So it&amp;rsquo;s not like it&amp;rsquo;s going away, but you should probably use the callout syntax going forward, just because that&amp;rsquo;s what everyone&amp;rsquo;s going to be developing based off of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;admonition-can-convert-between-formats&#34;&gt;Admonition can convert between formats&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there is also another thing that admonition is going to do is it does conversion. So if you have existing code block admonitions, then those can be converted to callouts. Actually, I want to show where you can find that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if you go to settings here and look at admonition, there are a bunch of settings here, but let&amp;rsquo;s look at, yeah, the conversions. You convert MSDoc admonitions to callouts, and you can convert code block admonitions to callouts as well. Now, this will modify your notes, so just be a little bit careful with it. Save a backup or do a push to Git if you save it in a Git repo like I do. But that&amp;rsquo;s what admonition is going to be doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;admonition-lets-you-change-callout-appearance&#34;&gt;Admonition lets you change callout appearance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in addition to that, it&amp;rsquo;s also shifted to being able to let you change the appearance of those callouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it has a bunch of functionality like, do you wanna add drop shadows? And do you want it to be collapsible by default? Because I said that it&amp;rsquo;s expanded by default, but you could change that behavior and toggle it. And then, you could still just expand it on a case-by-case basis. But if you don&amp;rsquo;t specify anything, then it&amp;rsquo;ll just say that it should be collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also the add copy button, which is actually really interesting because a lot of times that is something that I just want to copy and paste to like my players or something if I wanna paste a description or if it actually is a code block or some sort of troubleshooting thing, so I enable that. And you can set admonition colors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also change the icons that are loaded there. So right now, admonition uses the Font Awesome icons. So I was showing you all of these different types of callouts, right? But those are the default ones. And admonition adds the Font Awesome ones as well. And you can even add your own types of icons. So you can load additional icons. There&amp;rsquo;s Octicons and RPG-Awesome, which sounds really interesting, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And a cool effect of that is we need to do this in admonition syntax, so it&amp;rsquo;s code blocks. Let&amp;rsquo;s say, let&amp;rsquo;s just go with question. This is a question. A cool thing that you can do with admonition is you can do icon, and then choose an icon that isn&amp;rsquo;t already in there. So as an example, I happen to know that there is a Font Awesome icon that&amp;rsquo;s a cloud, so I&amp;rsquo;m just going to put cloud there and then I&amp;rsquo;m going to put, here&amp;rsquo;s the answer. If I go out there, look, now it looks like a little green cloud, so I can change everything about how it looks. This is still in the admonition syntax, though, but it functions the same way as callouts, just extended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like this for being able to give instructions and then say, you know, this is Apple-only and not for Windows. So that&amp;rsquo;s really cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;should-you-keep-using-obsidian-admonition&#34;&gt;Should you keep using Obsidian Admonition?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I guess the question is, and this was my question when I learned about these changes, is it still worthwhile to use admonitions because of all these quality-of-life improvements?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it is, because, don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I&amp;rsquo;m very happy that callouts is part of Obsidian now, that just made sense for an app that is so focused on notes and note-taking and documentation. You really need these different ways to take notes on your notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;custom-icons-and-admonition-types&#34;&gt;Custom icons and admonition types&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I do think think that admonition is still worthwhile installing and using if you want to delve down into the specifics of this feature. So if you want different icons that make sense to you, but maybe not to other people, this is still the best way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;user-interface-for-inserting-callouts-or-admonitions&#34;&gt;User interface for inserting callouts OR admonitions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another cool thing that I didn&amp;rsquo;t show, let me show that now, is maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t want to remember the syntax with either with the blockquotes or with the code blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with admonition turned on and enable, installed and enabled, you can bring up your command pane, which for me is Command + P, and I&amp;rsquo;m gonna type in admonition, and then you can just either a callout or an admonition and a bunch of other things as well, but I&amp;rsquo;m just going to insert a callout. And if you didn&amp;rsquo;t remember what the types were, they&amp;rsquo;re all here. And this is what they&amp;rsquo;re going to look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as I mentioned, I think these, the ones that I grouped, are actually supposed to look the same without the admonition plugin, it&amp;rsquo;s just that either the admonition plugin or my theme is making them look a little bit different, but these are the standard ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So then you can choose which one you want. You can have the title there. You can choose whether or not it is collapsible. It even shows you a preview. So let&amp;rsquo;s insert that. And look, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to type out any of that and I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to remember any of that syntax. So that&amp;rsquo;s just a nice little upgrade that you can only get with admonitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-callouts-is-available-now&#34;&gt;Obsidian callouts is available now&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Obsidian callouts is available for all users for free now!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, Obsidian callouts, at the time of this recording, is only available in Insider Build version 0.14, which means you can only get it right now, if you need to get it right now, you&amp;rsquo;d have to pay for the Catalyst plan, which is a one-off $25 fee. I&amp;rsquo;ve paid that just because I wanted to give back to the Obsidian developers for this amazing tool that they just give for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if you&amp;rsquo;re willing to wait, this feature, like all features, will soon be publicly available, Insiders just get it a little bit earlier. And when that happens, I&amp;rsquo;ll pin a comment in the comments below for this video so that you know when it&amp;rsquo;s available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if you&amp;rsquo;d like to learn about other Obsidian plugins, I do have &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/W7kTtn9empU&#34;&gt;a video on the top 10 Obsidian plugins&lt;/a&gt;, so maybe check that out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for watching!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why I Chose Obsidian Over Roam Research (as a Roam investor)</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220309-why-i-chose-obsidian-over-roam/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220309-why-i-chose-obsidian-over-roam/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was a Roam Research power user, a Believer, and investor before I discovered Obsidian. Here&amp;rsquo;s why I still ended up choosing Obsidian over Roam as my personal knowledge management tool of choice. My goal with this video is to share with you my reasons for making the choice that I did, not to judge you or anyone else who disagrees. In the end, we all have to decide for ourselves what tool fits best in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Top 10 Obsidian Plugins I Can&#39;t Do Without</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220223-top-10-obsidian-plugins/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 17:00:08 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220223-top-10-obsidian-plugins/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about my experience in getting started with &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;, and how I went from thinking it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t meet my needs at all to not being able to shut up about how awesome it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/W7kTtn9empU&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I tried to use Obsidian, I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it. It didn&amp;rsquo;t seem intuitive to use. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t quite get it to do what I wanted. And frankly, I just didn&amp;rsquo;t get all of the hype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I have over 10,000 notes over multiple vaults in Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what changed? Well, it turns out that there&amp;rsquo;s a pretty crucial element of the experience that I was missing the first time around and that&amp;rsquo;s plugins. Here are my top 10 community plugins for Obsidian so that you don&amp;rsquo;t make the same mistake. \&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian already comes with some core plugins, some of which are enabled by default. Today, I&amp;rsquo;m talking about community plugins, which are extensions to Obsidian that are created by other Obsidian users. The security of your notes is still on you though so think about what you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable with before installing anything. \&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-calendar-and-fantasy-calendar&#34;&gt;Obsidian Calendar and Fantasy Calendar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 10 plugins are arranged alphabetically and the first one is Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calendar is the most popular Obsidian plugin and for a reason. I don&amp;rsquo;t know at this point why you would ever install Obsidian without the Calendar plugin because Obsidian doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a native implementation of a calendar. The Calendar plugin doesn&amp;rsquo;t just show the calendar. It also lets you create daily notes and see those daily notes over the entire month. And it also lets you create weekly reviews if you have that option enabled, which I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Calendar and this other plugin, Fantasy Calendar. Even though Fantasy Calendar definitely was made for use in a tabletop role playing game like Dungeons and Dragons, you don&amp;rsquo;t have use it as that. I&amp;rsquo;ve used Fantasy Calendar as my content calendar in Obsidian. It just provides a little bit more customization than the Calendar plugin can but I install and use both heavily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-dataview&#34;&gt;Obsidian Dataview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number two is Dataview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dataview has changed the way I use Obsidian. It&amp;rsquo;s changed the way I format my notes. It essentially allows you to define parameters and values in the YAML front matter or the metadata of your notes and then it lets you search for them. So it essentially lets you create your own database in Obsidian with custom fields for anything that you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could use it for meetings or people or tools or books that you&amp;rsquo;ve read. The possibilities are endless. By the way, in addition to the very SQL-like query language that they have, you can also use JavaScript in Dataview. There&amp;rsquo;s just so much to do with this plugin. And I really haven&amp;rsquo;t even scratched the surface of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-editor-syntax-highlight&#34;&gt;Obsidian Editor Syntax Highlight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number three is so small but so useful that I had to include it in the list. It is Editor Syntax Highlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever copied over any code into Obsidian, you may find that it lacks a little bit in readability. Editors Syntax Highlight dramatically improves readability by changing the syntax highlighting depending on the programming language that you select. It isn&amp;rsquo;t going to replace VS Code anytime soon, but if you&amp;rsquo;re like me and you use it sort of as a dev log while you&amp;rsquo;re trying figure something out and you include your final solution or the code into your note, then I think that this is a must-have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-kanban&#34;&gt;Obsidian Kanban&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number four is Kanban which is funny because I don&amp;rsquo;t even usually like the Kanban approach. I never understood Trello and I never liked Post-it Notes. I don&amp;rsquo;t use Kanban for task management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered what it&amp;rsquo;s really good for is a content calendar. I create a card in Kanban for every bit of content that I&amp;rsquo;d like to work on, whether that&amp;rsquo;s code or a section in a workshop, a blog post, a video, or really basically anything. I really like being able to create my own columns and spicing it up by embedding photos within the card itself. It just makes the whole process a lot more visual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-outliner&#34;&gt;Obsidian Outliner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number five is Outliner. Before Obsidian, I was using Roam and it definitely shows. While I&amp;rsquo;ve moved on philosophically from Roam Research, I still love the very task-oriented bulletin format that it had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, Outliner brings the same thing to Obsidian. So you can have your keyboard shortcuts for quickly moving something up and down a list or indenting and unindenting as well. It has made my transition from Roam Research significantly easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-periodic-notes&#34;&gt;Obsidian Periodic Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number six is Periodic Notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think one of the most fundamental philosophical differences between Obsidian and tools like Evernote is that Obsidian doesn&amp;rsquo;t want you to just capture it all. Obsidian is about bringing those notes to the forefront, processing them, analyzing them, really learning them, and then changing them as your knowledge changes and Periodic Notes really helps with that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is particularly useful for OKR or objective setting because it provides a system for reviewing notes daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to use all of those, but I find that using some of them is really useful in helping me step back and think about what I actually want to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-publish&#34;&gt;Obsidian Publish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number seven probably would be my number one if I were ranking these, but since it&amp;rsquo;s alphabetical, number seven is Obsidian Publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian Publish is a premium add-on to Obsidian that lets you instantly publish all of your notes or at least the notes that you select to be published to a certain domain. Now I have it going to a custom domain and yes, it&amp;rsquo;s not free. And yes, I do know that there are other ways that you could do this with markdown files. I have my personal blog using Hugo as a static generator for instance, but there&amp;rsquo;s just something about Publish and just it taking just a few clicks between writing something and putting it out there that really reduces the inertia for me to learn in public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning in public and growing a digital garden that is constantly changing is really important to me and it has been essential to my professional and personal development. So Obsidian Publish has to be, hands-down, my favorite plugin for Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-readwise-official&#34;&gt;Obsidian Readwise Official&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number eight is the Readwise Official plugin and this is a plugin that I&amp;rsquo;ve been wanting for a very long time. In fact, before the official plugin came out, I created my own Python script that I was running regularly just to be able to move my things from Readwise to Obsidian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt;, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know, is a way to collect all of the things that you&amp;rsquo;re doing on the internet. It&amp;rsquo;s an easy way to collect eBooks, web articles, audiobooks, tweets, and even PDFs. And it all brings your highlights of those into your Obsidian vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a really essential part to my learning process because it ensures that everything I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from a variety of different sources ends up in my Obsidian vault for me to process and analyze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-sync&#34;&gt;Obsidian Sync&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number nine is Obsidian Sync and it is also a premium add-on, kind of like Obsidian Publish, but it&amp;rsquo;s also totally optional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t really need Obsidian Sync. I already use Dropbox, but unfortunately, one of the problems with Dropbox is that you can&amp;rsquo;t yet use it to sync between different devices. I use Obsidian on my laptop, on my iPad, and on my Samsung mobile. So I have three different devices that I need all of my notes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently two options for this. It&amp;rsquo;s either iCloud or Obsidian Sync. I don&amp;rsquo;t like iCloud, and so, Obsidian Sync is my service of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;obsidian-templater&#34;&gt;Obsidian Templater&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Number 10 is the most recent plugin of this 10 and it is Templater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now don&amp;rsquo;t get it confused with Templates which is an Obsidian core plugin. TemplateR is a community plugin that&amp;rsquo;s like Templates on steroids. It extends templating functionality by letting you run JavaScript in your vault. This blows the functionality of Obsidian wide open as now I can run JavaScript in my vault to do certain things for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was already a fan of the core plugin Templates, so having Templater and all of the customization options that are possible is just amazing. Definitely recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve made it this far and you&amp;rsquo;re wondering what the heck is Obsidian, well maybe take a step back and watch this video on how to get started with Obsidian. And if you want to know about my usage of any of the particular plugins that I mentioned, leave me a comment below so that I know that I should make a video on that next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for watching. Happy note taking!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last few months, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying out an app called &lt;a href=&#34;https://reclaim.ai&#34;&gt;Reclaim&lt;/a&gt; that has been changing my mind about the feasibility of calendar blocking for time management in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my (rave) review of the app!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started using &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; for professional reasons. I use it daily as my main task management and personal knowledge management system for my main job as a software developer advocate at &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io&#34;&gt;k6.io&lt;/a&gt;. However, a surprising use case of mine for Obsidian is playing Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons, the tabletop roleplaying game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a video of me walking through my setup for how to use Obsidian to create my own &amp;ldquo;DM&amp;rsquo;s Brain Attic&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Calendar blocking is the only way to identify and avoid distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world that tempts us with &amp;ldquo;a little bit of everything, all of the time,&amp;rdquo; resisting distraction is the most valuable skill. Yet distraction isn&amp;rsquo;t always easy to recognize, especially when it comes in the guise of other things we need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how to use calendar blocking to gain control over your schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;set-realistic-schedules&#34;&gt;Set realistic schedules.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting an overly ambitious schedule inevitably leads to disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hard part is figuring out what&amp;rsquo;s infeasible, and that has to come with time. In the meantime, &lt;em&gt;expect to change your schedule.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-digital-tools&#34;&gt;Use digital tools.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calendar Tetris isn&amp;rsquo;t fun&amp;ndash; but there are tools that can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you expect to change your schedule, choose tools that make that easier. I use &lt;a href=&#34;http://Reclaim.ai&#34;&gt;Reclaim.ai&lt;/a&gt; to change my calendar in response to changing priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;do-a-weekly-review&#34;&gt;Do a weekly review.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Review how well you stuck to your schedule and adjust it accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good schedule, like a good budget, changes over time. Set aside a time every week to assess the previous week and set priorities for the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;relate-your-schedule-to-your-core-principles&#34;&gt;Relate your schedule to your core principles.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your calendar should be the reflection of the values you hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what are those values? Keep a list of the principles you live by (or want to live by). Look at your calendar as a way to keep yourself on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reframe-restriction-as-freedom&#34;&gt;Reframe restriction as freedom.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you don&amp;rsquo;t set your calendar, others set it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restriction isn&amp;rsquo;t following a schedule &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; set. Restriction is being subject to the passing whims of bugs and meetings that demand your attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;calendar-blocking-defends-your-time&#34;&gt;Calendar blocking defends your time.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It frees you to do things you decide are important.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Things the Obsidian Templater Plugin Can Do That Templates Can&#39;t</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220131-5-things-the-obsidian-templater-can-do-that-templates-cant/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2022 22:46:52 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220131-5-things-the-obsidian-templater-can-do-that-templates-cant/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Templater plugin is what the core Templates plugin should have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name is unfortunate, as it implies that the two plugins are similar. Turns out they&amp;rsquo;re only similar in that one is a limited version of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what you can do with Templater&amp;ndash; and not with Templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;add-dynamic-variables-to-your-notes&#34;&gt;Add dynamic variables to your notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re probably thinking, &lt;em&gt;but Templates can already add dates&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templater can do that, &lt;em&gt;and more&lt;/em&gt;. You can use it to fetch values in YAML frontmatter, random quotes from the interwebs, and even clipboard contents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;make-your-notes-context-sensitive&#34;&gt;Make your notes context-sensitive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templater can create notes with different templates depending on context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, you could set up Obsidian to create a new note using the &lt;em&gt;Person&lt;/em&gt; template in the &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt; folder but a &lt;em&gt;Weekly Review&lt;/em&gt; note on Sunday nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;increment-your-notes-automatically&#34;&gt;Increment your notes automatically&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templater can automatically increment new instances of a series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can set it up to create a session log for your 100th D&amp;amp;D session, a review note for your 12th monthly review, or your 10th book review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;interact-with-other-plugins&#34;&gt;Interact with other plugins&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templater leverages all the best parts of Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read from and write to YAML frontmatter using Dataview, or run commands that create notes based on text input with Buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;write-and-run-your-own-scripts&#34;&gt;Write and run your own scripts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Templater lets you write and call user scripts within an Obsidian note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the ultimate in extensibility. The ability to run custom JavaScript means you&amp;rsquo;re limited only by your imagination (and skill).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;templater-lets-you-turn-obsidian-into-exactly-what-you-want&#34;&gt;Templater lets you turn Obsidian into exactly what you want.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And isn&amp;rsquo;t that what a PKM should do?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>10 Mandatory Obsidian Plugins for Every Software Engineer</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220129-10-mandatory-obsidian-plugins-for-every-software-engineer/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 29 Jan 2022 23:58:12 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220129-10-mandatory-obsidian-plugins-for-every-software-engineer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;rsquo;t installed any Obsidian plugins, you&amp;rsquo;re missing out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many other mainstream PKM apps seem to have been built with the intention of hand-holding users through every step using a pretty interface. On the other hand, Obsidian is perfectly suited to power users who want to change the tool to meet their needs exactly. But you can only do that with plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are 10 Obsidian plugins you should install if you work in tech:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;enable-these-core-plugins&#34;&gt;Enable these Core Plugins.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core plugins are shipped with Obsidian but are disabled by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily notes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Creates a new Markdown page according to a specified template that serves as a scratchpad and springboard for every new day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Templates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Lets you define predetermined formats that can be inserted into notes. Some template examples: Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Yearly notes, meeting notes with agendas, person notes to create your own CRM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Backlinks&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; When you have a note open, this shows you all the other notes that have referred to it, explicitly (via [[links]]) or implicitly (unlinked).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quick switcher&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Lets you find any note by hitting CMD+O and showing search results as you type. With this enabled, I never bother with folders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Workspaces&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Lets you save the exact arrangement of notes and sidebar options you have selected, and then load it quickly later. I have workspaces for writing, processing content, playing D&amp;amp;D, and making videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;install-these-community-plugins&#34;&gt;Install these Community Plugins.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community plugins are created by users and open-sourced on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Calendar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Adds a real-world calendar to your side panel that shows daily and weekly notes. Use Fantasy Calendar for even more customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Editor Syntax Highlight&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Formats text in code blocks according to the programming language set. Drastically improves readability of any code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Readwise Official&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Regularly imports your highlights from ebooks, web articles, audiobooks, tweets, and PDFs into your Obsidian vault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Templater&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Extends templating functionality by letting you run JAVASCRIPT. In your vault! This blows the functionality of Obsidian wide open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dataview&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; Turns your Obsidian vault into a database using custom parameters in YAML frontmatter. There&amp;rsquo;s even a way to write queries in js!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
