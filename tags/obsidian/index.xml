      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve recently transitioned from Roam Research to Obsidian, you might run into a few issues, even after you&amp;rsquo;ve run the &amp;ldquo;Markdown format importer&amp;rdquo; core plugin. One of the most annoying ones that I ran into was that files uploaded to Roam (images, pdfs, etc.) are automatically uploaded to Google Firebase.
Roam assets are linked to in the Markdown files like this:
![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-471a1.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMyNotes%2FxRFXx7l-ZK.png?alt=media&amp;amp;token=1e03b680-5472-33dc-9b06-a127301af37f) Now, since Roam relies on security by obscurity on this front, the links to your assets will still be accessible in your Obsidian vault, and they&amp;rsquo;ll still render correctly.</description>

      <title>Interview on Performance Time Podcast</title>

      <description>I first heard of Stephen Townshend because he happens to have gotten the same introduction to performance testing that I did&amp;ndash; our shared mentor, Stijn Schephers. He has started a podcast called Performance Time, where he interviews performance engineers about a variety of topics. This week, it was me!
 We talked about how I got started, one of my biggest failures as a performance tester, chaos engineering, what we can do to improve diversity in tech, and why I think note-taking is a key skill for any performance tester.</description>

      <title>How I Use Obsidian at Work</title>

      <description>Note-taking and personal knowledge management get talked about in academic circles, by both students and teachers. But there&amp;rsquo;s not much said about its use outside of the academe.
I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, due to my job description, I may be in a better position than most to take advantage of note-taking in a professional context. My background is in software performance testing. My job for several years has been to make sure that applications are prepared to withstand traffic from many users accessing it, usually by writing code to simulate that traffic before it&amp;rsquo;s released to real users.</description>

      <title>Presentation Slides as Code</title>

      <description>I was working on a presentation for later this month when Marie Drake told me about slides.com. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a Powerpoint replacement (which, let&amp;rsquo;s be honest, needs replacing) in that it lets you create slides and it lets you present from it. It even goes beyond Powerpoint in that it also saves your slides publicly for people to view later.
Before she&amp;rsquo;d mentioned slides.com, I had been planning on creating a presentation on Obsidian, my note-taking tool of choice.</description>

      <title>Readwise to Obsidian</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m about 9 months into heavily using Roam Research as my primary note-taking, task management, capture-everything system, and for the most part, that&amp;rsquo;s gone very well. Obsidian is another excellent personal knowledge management (PKM) system, though, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been curious about it for almost as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Roam. I&amp;rsquo;ve had it installed for a while, but I never really seriously attempted to make the switch. Until now.</description>
