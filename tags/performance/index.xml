      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week for k6 Office Hours, I talked to one of the newest members on our team, &lt;a href=&#34;https://srperf.com&#34;&gt;Leandro Melendez, aka Señor Performo&lt;/a&gt;, about his experience in joining k6/Grafana Labs. We ended up talking about performance &amp;ldquo;deadly sins&amp;rdquo; and how the practice of performance engineering has changed in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Do What Kind of Testing When: Testing Types by Scope</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220122-how-to-do-what-kind-of-testing-when/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220122-how-to-do-what-kind-of-testing-when/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Correctly identifying &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you test could be just as important as &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt;. Below are types of testing according to scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;static-testing&#34;&gt;Static testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Static testing occurs when requirements are written. Question requirements and spell out what each one means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concerns:&lt;/em&gt; Setting up a system to track and link requirements to test cases, negotiating business needs with technical feasibility, clarifying scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;unit-testing&#34;&gt;Unit testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unit testing occurs when coding begins. Practice Test-Driven Development by translating requirements into tests before writing the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concerns:&lt;/em&gt; Treating test code like application code, getting developer buy-in, communicating technical implementation, performance, pair programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;system-testing&#34;&gt;System testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System testing occurs when a build is released. Employ black-box testing: step back from the code and assess the feature as a whole for consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concerns:&lt;/em&gt; Adherence to common design standards, equivalence partitioning, boundary value analysis, fighting scope creep, usability, creating test data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;system-integration-testing-sit&#34;&gt;System integration testing (SIT)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SIT occurs when integrating multiple components. Use white-box or grey-box testing to target the interactions and traffic between components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concerns:&lt;/em&gt; API testing, stubbing and mocking, identifying request paths throughout the system, performance benchmarking, observability and analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;business-acceptance-testing-bat&#34;&gt;Business acceptance testing (BAT)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BAT occurs when the code is assessed against overall business goals. Seek out SMEs who can help you verify expected outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concerns:&lt;/em&gt; Adherence to business requirements and regulations, process testing, simplifying request flows, identifying potential customer pain points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;user-acceptance-testing-uat&#34;&gt;User acceptance testing (UAT)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User acceptance testing occurs before code is released to production. Map test cases to requirements and test real-world scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concerns:&lt;/em&gt; Testing for superuser workflows, data cleansing, verifying real user behavior from historical logs, exploratory testing, end-to-end performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;regression-testing&#34;&gt;Regression Testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regression testing occurs between builds. Supplement a robust automation test suite with nuanced manual test cases that address known problem areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Concerns:&lt;/em&gt; Setting up a CI/CD pipeline, deciding what to automate, consolidating test and development tools, tracking failures over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;question-everything&#34;&gt;Question everything&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember: &lt;strong&gt;testing is an attitude.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, my former colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simon Aronsson&lt;/a&gt; brought his &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; colleague, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mmanciop&#34;&gt;Michele Mancioppi&lt;/a&gt;, to k6 Office Hours to talk about observability, and how they do it at &lt;a href=&#34;https://canonical.com&#34;&gt;Canonical&lt;/a&gt;. It turned into a great conversation about trends in observability from the last decade, and how it relates to performance and reliability testing.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>An Overview of Software Testing</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220119-an-overview-of-software-testing/</link>

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/huiptd8Y2I0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: What is the difference between good software and bad software? Is it features or user interface or marketing? In my totally biased opinion, what actually makes a difference is how well the software was tested. But software testing encompasses a lot of different areas and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even always have to be someone with a word tester in their job title that does the testing. So whether you&amp;rsquo;re looking to get started in the industry, or just trying to cross skill, here&amp;rsquo;s an overview of the main types of software testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is it just me, or does your desk get that clutter too after a week of work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, software testing is the process of validating whether an application works as intended, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of vagueness in that statement. One of the broadest ways to categorize testing types though, is whether it&amp;rsquo;s functional or operational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional testing is more about application features. Is there a form to capture user email addresses? Is there a button next to it that submits those addresses? Once the button is clicked, where do the user details go? Do they go to the database? Are they stored correctly? Those are the sort of ways in which functional testers think. Operational testing traditionally called non-functional testing, is a way of verifying software quality and aspects that extend beyond the features of the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operational testing sometimes involves concerns that are more subjective or qualitative. So it can be a little bit more difficult to test, because those things only arise in certain conditions. I&amp;rsquo;m saying operational testing here, instead of non-functional testing, because I was talking to Paul Bruce who made an excellent video just on this topic. He talks about why the term nonfunctional requirement is really a bit of a misnomer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAUL: It relegates all these other things, security, performance, installation, deployment, accessibility. It relegates them to a nice to have, so it should be functional versus operational.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So I&amp;rsquo;m using his term operational testing instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the different forms of operational or non-functional testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First there&amp;rsquo;s accessibility testing. It is involved with verifying that end users can consume or navigate content. Usually through assistive devices like screen readers. While most forms of testing begin with a statistically normal user in mind, accessibility testing seeks out outliers in terms of location, linguistic background and disability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usability testing is designing with user experience in mind, specifically concerning the placement of on-screen elements and the intuitiveness of the process flow of an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Localization testing is a way of making sure that applications are usable in the local context, in the sense of being colloquially appropriate for users in different countries and from different cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security testing verifies that a system has no flaws that could be exploited, to gain access to confidential information or features that would not otherwise be accessed by expected means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that was me talking from my home in the Netherlands, but this week I am in Portugal. The remote working life, am I right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But anyway, performance testing is my favorite topic and my favorite type of testing because that&amp;rsquo;s the one that I&amp;rsquo;ve had the most experience with. Performance testing is more qualitative. So it&amp;rsquo;s more about how well the application works. And there are two main types of performance testing and that&amp;rsquo;s front-end performance, and back-end performance testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Front-end performance testing seeks to verify the user experience at the interface level. So that&amp;rsquo;s everything that the end user sees on their local machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different approaches to front-end performance testing, and the first of them is performance profiling. Performance profiling involves running your application through a series of automated checks. And there are a lot of sites for this, where you just put in your URL, if it&amp;rsquo;s a web app, and you get a score in the end. That tells you how performance your application is, the most popular example for this and also the easiest to get started with, is DevTools because that&amp;rsquo;s already in Chrome and Firefox based browsers. But you can also go to sites like Webpagetest, or GTMetrix, YSlow, which is a plugin, or you can use Google Lighthouse, which is now included with Chrome Dev Tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next approach to front-end performance testing is called RUM or Real User Monitoring. So the difference is that with performance profiling, that&amp;rsquo;s often done manually, and as a one-off thing, like maybe at the beginning of a test or during, but Real User Monitoring is not usually done within testing environments. As the name suggests, these tools measure the experience of real users. So they have to be run in production. Examples of tools in this space are; New Relic&amp;rsquo;s RUM, Elastic has a RUM as well, there&amp;rsquo;s Catchpoint, SpeedCurve Uptrends and many more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the third approach to measuring front-end performance is by using some sort of browser-based automation tool. So typically this has been something like Selenium, but that&amp;rsquo;s falling out of favor in terms of more modern solutions like Playwright, Puppeteer, Cypress and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So front-end performance is about everything that the user sees on their end, but back-end performance testing is about everything that they don&amp;rsquo;t see. It&amp;rsquo;s about the network. It&amp;rsquo;s about latency, the application servers, the way the infrastructure is set up and all of those things that are a little bit more difficult to look into, but can also have severe bottlenecks. Back-end performance testing seeks to verify aspects of an application such as scalability, elasticity, availability, reliability and responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scalability is the application&amp;rsquo;s ability to respond to changes in demand. This could mean scaling up, which means increasing the resources available to a server, but it could also mean scaling out, meaning increasing the number of servers that are available to handle the application load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elasticity is a related topic to scalability, except where scalability is all about scaling up or out. Elasticity also emphasize a scaling down or in, and that&amp;rsquo;s because having these services or servers available on the Cloud that are dynamically adjusting can also be quite expensive. So elasticity makes sure that the infrastructure that&amp;rsquo;s available or the resources available are always appropriate for the size of the demand. So when demand increases, elasticity also checks whether the application decreases it servers or resources in response to that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Availability is how long the application stays up, despite changing circumstances in production. So this is typically measured by uptime. Availability can also be tested using disaster recovery procedures, and you&amp;rsquo;re not just testing the application itself, but also the processes around it. So are there enough people that are on call so that they would be able to come in and troubleshoot when there&amp;rsquo;s a production incident? All of those things are included in application availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliability checks to see how your application behaves in response to unexpected errors. Reliability basically takes it as a given that your application is going to fail somehow, sometime, maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly when that will be or how it will fail, but it&amp;rsquo;s going to happen. So a big part of reliability and site reliability engineering is trying to expose your application to those failures beforehand so that you can build confidence about how it will behave when those things actually happen in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the last aspect to back-end performance testing is responsiveness. And this is usually equated with load testing. Load testing is more of a technique for testing though. And really load tests can be used to test not just responsiveness, but also reliability or availability or scalability, basically any of the &amp;ldquo;ilities&amp;rdquo; in this part of back-end performance testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protocol-based load testing verifies the backend performance of an application, not by simulating real users accessing the application, but by simulating the underlying requests that go back and forth between the client or the user and the application servers. One of the benefits of protocol-based load testing is that it takes up fewer resources on the side of the load generator, and therefore is less expensive to run. Some popular protocol-based load testing tools are k6, JMeter, Gatling LoadRunner, NeoLoad, and Silk Performer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browser-based load testing verifies the application by simulating real users accessing it. So it also has the benefit of including these front-end performance metrics. Browser-based testing can also be called browser-driven or UI-based testing. Some popular tools for browser-based load testing are Playwright, Puppeteer, Flood Element and as of a few weeks ago, k6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there&amp;rsquo;s hybrid load testing, which takes the best of protocol and browser-based load testing tools by combining them in one test. Now this can present some challenges, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re using different tools for the browser-based script, than you&amp;rsquo;re using for the protocol-based script. The ideal is to use your protocol based load testing tool, to simulate majority of the load to cut down on costs for the execution and scaling out of your load test. And then you run a handful of users using your browser based load testing tool. So you still get some metrics for front-end performance while that load is being applied by the protocol based tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing software can be really daunting because there are many aspects of an application that you can test. But that&amp;rsquo;s because there&amp;rsquo;s also many aspects of an application that can fail. And that&amp;rsquo;s why all roads lead to testing and why the success of an app hinges on how well it&amp;rsquo;s been tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to zero in, on load testing in particular, check out this video that I made on what load testing is. Thanks for watching. And like they say, here in Portugal, Obrigada!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Use Executors in k6: Adapting Load Test Workload Models to Production</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220118-how-to-use-executors-in-k6-adapting-load-test-workload-models-to-production/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 22:45:52 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220118-how-to-use-executors-in-k6-adapting-load-test-workload-models-to-production/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Executors in k6 are like traffic cops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They define the shape and volume of traffic that your k6 load testing script follows during test execution. Executors can also drastically affect your results if you don&amp;rsquo;t get them right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are all the executor options in k6 and when you should use each one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;k6-executors&#34;&gt;k6 executors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;shared-iterations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Fix the number of total iterations for the entire test. Use when you want to create precisely X rows of test data during a prep run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;per-vu-iterations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Fix the number of iterations each virtual user (VU) does. Use when you want each VU to use exactly X rows of test data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;constant-vus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Fix the number of VUs and duration, but allow the number of iterations to vary. Use for straightforward tests or shakeout tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ramping-vus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Set stages, each with a number of VUs and a duration, and let the number of iterations vary. Use for easiest comparison with other load testing tools and for custom load profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;constant-arrival-rate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Fix the number of requests per second (rps) and duration, and allow the number of VUs and iterations to vary. Use when you have a simple load profile with a request throughput requirement (rps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ramping-arrival rate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;constant-arrival-rate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, but with stages. For each stage, fix the number of rps and duration. Use for spike tests, multiphase load profiles with distinct requirements, and Game Day simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;externally-controlled&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Fix max VUs and time, and allow everything else to be changed at runtime. Use for disaster recovery, breakpoint, or stress tests where you want ultimate flexibility in adapting your test to real-time results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;still-unsure&#34;&gt;Still unsure?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ramping-vus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s probably what you&amp;rsquo;re used to from other tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready to move up? Use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ramping-arrival-rate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Rps is a better (but still not perfect) measure of throughput for comparison than just the number of VUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-in-doubt-look-at-production&#34;&gt;When in doubt, look at production.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making sure your test looks and acts like real traffic yields the best results!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/scenarios/#executors&#34;&gt;the k6 documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Testing tool cheat sheet for load testers who don&#39;t just care about numbers</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220117-testing-tool-cheat-sheet-for-load-testers-who-dont-just-care-about-numbers/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 16:30:07 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220117-testing-tool-cheat-sheet-for-load-testers-who-dont-just-care-about-numbers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not enough to decide &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; load you want to generate. You also have to know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;rsquo;re generating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your approach affects what part of your application is tested, the results returned, and the budget you&amp;rsquo;ll need to run your test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are three main categories of load testing tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;protocol-based-load-testing-tools&#34;&gt;Protocol-based load testing tools:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tools simulate the underlying messages sent back and forth between an application and a client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose a protocol-based tool if&lt;/em&gt;: you want to generate massive load, you want to load test before components are integrated, you want to test APIs, or you are budget-conscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best in class tools&lt;/em&gt;: Gatling, JMeter, k6, Locust, Neoload&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;browser-based-load-testing-tools&#34;&gt;Browser-based load testing tools:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tools automate real user interactions with an interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose a browser-based tool if:&lt;/em&gt; you want to measure end-to-end performance, you want to reuse your browser automation scripts, you want front-end performance metrics, or you have a higher budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best in class tools:&lt;/em&gt; Cypress, Flood Element, k6, Playwright, Puppeteer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hybrid-load-testing-tools&#34;&gt;Hybrid load testing tools:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach is a mixture of the previous two. You can do this in a few ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a protocol tool to generate the majority of the load, and a browser tool for a handful of virtual users &lt;em&gt;(best functionality, highest effort/cost)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a browser-based tool for all load &lt;em&gt;(expensive, simplest)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a tool that can do both &lt;em&gt;(ideal solution, few options)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whatever-you-choose-compare-like-with-like&#34;&gt;Whatever you choose, compare like with like.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy testing!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was reading &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3tvLYM9&#34;&gt;Six Thinking Hats&lt;/a&gt; by Edward de Bono when I realized that the premise could be applied to performance testing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/six-performance-testing-hats.png&#34; alt=&#34;The Six Performance Testing Hats&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each hat represents a different way of thinking, which can be useful when working through issues. Sometimes, wearing only one hat can cause us to fixate on incorrect assumptions, and &amp;ldquo;putting on another hat&amp;rdquo; can help shake things up and get to actually fixing what went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Tabletop Games Teach Us About Application Perfomance</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220112-what-tabletop-games-teach-us-about-application-perfomance/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tabletop games and application performance have more in common than you might think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See, it&amp;rsquo;s all about optimization. Both involve juggling several variables: some that you can control, and some that you can&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about application performance from playing tabletop games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-get-more-workers&#34;&gt;#1: Get more workers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In worker placement games, you should always spend your first worker to train more workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, one of the most basic ways to increase concurrency is multithreading: using more than one thread at a time. (See: Golang) This applies to testing tools as much as to systems. The 1 Thread: 1 Virtual User paradigm is flawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-spend-time-on-getting-your-engine-going&#34;&gt;#2: Spend time on getting your engine going&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get your big combos in place before you tap to attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things like setting up automation frameworks or CI/CD pipelines DO set you back in the beginning, but they are worth their mana cost in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3draft-with-others-in-mind&#34;&gt;#3: Draft with others in mind&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trick to drafting is knowing what you&amp;rsquo;re leaving for others as much as what you&amp;rsquo;re taking for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short game is getting your team to do the testing. The long game is getting everyone in the company involved in testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-hope-for-a-nat-20-plan-for-a-nat-1&#34;&gt;#4: Hope for a nat 20, plan for a nat 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes proficiency, expertise, and a luckstone just aren&amp;rsquo;t enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of wondering &lt;em&gt;whether&lt;/em&gt; an app will fail, take for granted that it will, and start planning for it. Keep that Action Surge in your back pocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-sometimes-you-just-have-to-trade-for-sheep&#34;&gt;#5: Sometimes, you just have to trade for sheep&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2:1 port is valuable, but not always the best option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn what you can, but accept that you can&amp;rsquo;t learn it all. Reach out to others with compatible skillsets and ask the &amp;ldquo;stupid&amp;rdquo; questions that nobody else wants to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;testing-is-a-team-sport-and-everyone-gets-a-chance-to-play&#34;&gt;Testing is a team sport, and everyone gets a chance to play.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy gaming!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Ways to Use Obsidian as a Software Engineer</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220109-5-ways-to-use-obsidian-as-a-software-engineer/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 19:20:49 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220109-5-ways-to-use-obsidian-as-a-software-engineer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I wrote about why I think taking notes is the surprising foundation of a tester&amp;rsquo;s career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s not just testers. Every software engineer is a knowledge worker, and that means we get paid for what we know. Using a Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system such as &lt;a href=&#34;http://Obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian.md&lt;/a&gt; helps us keep up with the constant barrage of new ideas in tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are 5 things I use Obsidian for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-my-very-own-stack-overflow&#34;&gt;#1: My very own Stack Overflow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you code, you&amp;rsquo;ve used Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if you had your &lt;strong&gt;own&lt;/strong&gt; Stack Overflow, one that contained cheat sheets of every language you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried to hack something up in, including only commands relevant to your job? This is exactly &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Python&#34;&gt;what I&amp;rsquo;ve done for Python&lt;/a&gt; recently, and it&amp;rsquo;s helping me solidify my knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;2-tools-database&#34;&gt;#2: Tools database&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a tool for everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To keep them straight, I have a page for every load testing tool I try, with tutorials for how to get started, an assessment of its features, and observations I had while attempting to learn it. &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/k6+(tool)&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what I have for the load testing tool k6&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus: I also use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview&#34;&gt;the Dataview plugin&lt;/a&gt; to query tools that fit my criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;3-an-agile-workspace&#34;&gt;#3: An Agile workspace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Agile is good enough for my professional work, it&amp;rsquo;s good enough for my personal work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban&#34;&gt;Kanban plugin&lt;/a&gt; to keep track of projects, create weekly and monthly review/retro templates, and work iteratively using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bjsi/incremental-writing&#34;&gt;the Incremental Writing plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;4-a-public-learning-log&#34;&gt;#4: A public learning log&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learning in public is the fastest way to improve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m trying to figure something out, I document my attempts. With Obsidian Publish, I can quickly push this log out to my domain and share them with colleagues to get a quick review so that they can easily follow my train of thought and tell me where I went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;5-a-digital-garden-of-software-ideas&#34;&gt;#5: A digital garden of software ideas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build libraries, not feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use Obsidian to save things I read/watch/listen to but also to save space for ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to germinate. I publish notes before they&amp;rsquo;re fully fleshed out, with the goal of growing everything over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com&#34;&gt;Today, I have 4,567 notes&lt;/a&gt;, all about things that matter to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every engineer should have a PKM system.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Take Notes, Not Tools</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220108-take-notes-not-tools/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 17:00:44 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220108-take-notes-not-tools/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I first got into testing, I thought that testing was about learning different tools and frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned how to use Neoload, then LoadRunner, then JMeter, and then SeleniumSilkPerformerVisualStudioGatlingPuppeteerPlaywrightk6 in short succession. I took courses on JavaScript, on C, on Java. I ticked off tools like a grocery list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t take me long to realize that I still wasn&amp;rsquo;t a good tester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;taking-notes-not-tools-is-what-makes-a-good-tester&#34;&gt;Taking notes, not tools, is what makes a good tester.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you think about it, a lot of things a tester does revolves around taking good notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirements are just notes on what the business wants to achieve. Test scenarios are notes on situations that the team wants to simulate. Test cases are notes on how a user would use an application. Defects are notes on issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quality of a tester&amp;rsquo;s notes dictates the quality of their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;listen-to-people-not-tool-tutorials&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen to people, not tool tutorials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take notes on what users do.&lt;/strong&gt; Talk to the business. Pore through Google Analytics logs. Piece together a story of the kind of people who use your application, and how they use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take notes on problem areas.&lt;/strong&gt; Talk to customer support about the most common questions they get&amp;ndash; they know more about pain points than anyone else in the company. Talk to the ops engineers who were on call during the last production incident. These problems are what you&amp;rsquo;ll need to test later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take notes on what you&amp;rsquo;ve learned.&lt;/strong&gt; If you don&amp;rsquo;t like learning, you&amp;rsquo;re in the wrong field. Document everything, even things you think you&amp;rsquo;ll never forget, because one day, you WILL forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking notes, not tools, is the foundation every testing career is built on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this k6 Office Hours, k6 CEO Robin Gustafsson joined me to talk to Daniel Knittl-Frank, a software engineer at Eurofunk, about how k6 is used in the emergency services industry. Daniel has an interesting use case for k6: he uses it to load test calls in Austria received from the 112 emergency services hotline!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Last year, Pokemon GO, a mobile app developed by Niantic Labs, made $1.23 billion in revenue with 166 million players from all over the world. This level of success is unprecedented, especially for an app that was encouraging people to go outside at a time when many governments were encouraging them to stay inside. In tech, though, success comes at a cost. Here&amp;rsquo;s what Niantic has to do under the hood to keep this massively popular game running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone, I&amp;rsquo;m Nicole van der Hoeven. I&amp;rsquo;ve been helping companies
through their load testing for over 10 years, and I like to talk about tech travel and taking notes. I&amp;rsquo;m also a Pokemon GO player. I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing it since
the day it was released in July 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, I&amp;rsquo;m going to be reacting to a conversation between Priyanka Vergadia from Google and James Prompanya from Niantic Labs. Thank you to Joe Colantonio&amp;rsquo;s TestGuild News Show last month, for bringing it to my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: Yep.
NICOLE: Okay. Everybody knows that you should be doing a curve ball to catch Pokemon the fastest way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: I am catching some Pokemons. Did you know that it was
built on Google Cloud? Well, let&amp;rsquo;s talk&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: GCP, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: At Niantic Labs to take a behind the scenes look at Pokemon Go&amp;rsquo;s architecture, and how it scales for large number of players. Hi James, welcome to the show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: Pokemon Go is not your typical mobile game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I love that he&amp;rsquo;s got Pokemon paraphernalia everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: Catching these little creatures around you called Pokemon that are
appearing in a real world. Encourage you to go outside, explore and discover things using augmented reality. A big part of that, which wasn&amp;rsquo;t in&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: See this is one of the things that make me really impressed with their implementation. They have majority of their users using mobile networks. That&amp;rsquo;s a really hard thing to account for, especially when you&amp;rsquo;re talking about a global audience that is playing in different parts of the world. So it&amp;rsquo;s really important that everything is front-loaded, and that they&amp;rsquo;re minimizing the amount of traffic, the amount of resources that each player has to download on their mobile network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: Wasn&amp;rsquo;t included in the game when it first came out, was this big community aspect of it. We really liked this part of the game. So we made it a major part by hosting regular live events, such as Community Days, Raid Hours,Team GO Rocket Takeovers, all culminates in this big summer event that we call GO Fest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: So it&amp;rsquo;s&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So this is a really brave move as well because they have events that are timed. So they happen at the same time for people in that time zone. And earlier on in Pokemon Go&amp;rsquo;s history, I did experience some slowness and some congestion in the mobile networks. But I mean, that&amp;rsquo;s a really difficult thing for them to plan for. I&amp;rsquo;m interested to see how they solve that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: How does Pokemon Go back and actually scale to handle these peaks in traffic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: So we use Google Cloud. (chuckles) We have lots of services that need scaling such as the Google Kubernetes Engine and Spanner. Our front-end service is hosted on GKE, and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy to scale the nodes there. Google Cloud provides us with all the tools we need to manage the Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So it&amp;rsquo;s really cool to hear him talking about their stacks. So they&amp;rsquo;re using GCP, Google Cloud Platform. They&amp;rsquo;re on Kubernetes, so they&amp;rsquo;re using GKE, the Google Kubernetes Engine. And they use Google Cloud Spanner, which is a very highly available relational database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: To give an idea of scale, we have about 5,000 spanner nodes handling the traffic and thousands of Kubernetes nodes running just for the Pokemon&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: That is so interesting. 5,000 Spanner nodes. That&amp;rsquo;s just for the data. That makes sense because Niantic&amp;rsquo;s main reason for creating this game, or the way that they&amp;rsquo;re making money, I guess, is by getting the data from users about walking paths and &amp;hellip;Basically, geo location or spatial data. So it&amp;rsquo;s super important for them to be able to store the data that they&amp;rsquo;re getting from their application usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: We also have the various microservices that host other parts of the&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So another thing that they&amp;rsquo;re doing to keep it scalable is
by using microservices. See the traditional way is to use a monolith, so one large application with many sub-components. The problem with that though, is you can&amp;rsquo;t independently scale those components, you&amp;rsquo;d have to scale the entire application. And when that application is already really big and complex, that&amp;rsquo;s really inefficient because you&amp;rsquo;re scaling everything, even services that you
may not need to scale. So it&amp;rsquo;s really smart that they&amp;rsquo;ve chosen for a microservices based architecture, so that each of those components can be scaled separately of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: And if you compare ourselves to maybe World of Warcraft, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that other massively multiplayer online games, they split players into multiple realms, but for us, all of our players, they reside on a single realm. It was important for us that players can always interact with each other and share the same game, the experience, no matter where or when they&amp;rsquo;re playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: Yeah&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Okay. So I happen to have also played WoW, World of Warcraft. My main &amp;lsquo;toon was a disciplined priest. So when you sign up to WoW, you have to choose a realm, that&amp;rsquo;s basically a server or group of servers so that they don&amp;rsquo;t have to shoulder the entire load from all users. So that was WoW&amp;rsquo;s way to reduce the load. And he&amp;rsquo;s making the point that Pokemon Go can&amp;rsquo;t really do that to a certain extent. It&amp;rsquo;s not entirely correct to say that they don&amp;rsquo;t have
that sort of splintering, because they do still splinter based on the time zone. You&amp;rsquo;re only seeing people in that location in your time zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even events, they sometimes say 10:00 AM in your local time. So you&amp;rsquo;re not necessarily playing at the same time that people in Australia are playing. So there is some splintering, but it is less than what there would be for a game like WoW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: When we&amp;rsquo;re looking at different providers, we saw that Spanner
has consistent indexing that allows us to do more complex database schemas with these primary and secondary keys. Data Store was also non-relational with atomic and durable transactions. So we needed a relational database with full consistency, and made the choice to go to Spanner, which gave us these global ACID transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So he&amp;rsquo;s talking about consistency, global consistency, being a big deal and a big factor for why they chose to go and use Google Cloud Spanner instead of Google Data Store. And the reason is that normally, when you have a bunch of different instances of database, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter so much that those requests are processed in exactly the order that they came in. Because usually those
requests are being made by different people, and they&amp;rsquo;re trying to change different accounts. But with Pokemon Go, there&amp;rsquo;s the added complexity of wanting to keep the integrity of the chronological order. So if I go and attack a gym before you do, my, the process, the request that I created by attacking the gym, should be processed before yours is because it matters who gets to the gym first. So that&amp;rsquo;s an interesting twist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: Now let&amp;rsquo;s say I&amp;rsquo;m a player and I&amp;rsquo;m playing the game right now. I open my app to catch a Pokemon. What is happening behind the scenes? How does the request flow work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: When the user catches a Pokemon, we receive that request through the Google Cloud Load Balancer. All of the static media is also stored on Google Cloud storage buckets. And it&amp;rsquo;s downloaded to the phone when you first start the app. We also have caching enabled at the load balancers. So it&amp;rsquo;s&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Already, they&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned they have a load balancer, so that that&amp;rsquo;s like a traffic controller that&amp;rsquo;s sitting above the servers and saying, &amp;ldquo;Okay, this request goes to this server.&amp;rdquo; And then maybe when that server is processing too many requests, that load balancer should be able to say, &amp;ldquo;All right, now let&amp;rsquo;s
divert some of the traffic to another server that maybe isn&amp;rsquo;t as heavily utilized.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also mentioned that they employ caching. This is what I was saying earlier that because you want to minimize the amount of traffic and the bytes that are flowing on the network, you want to employ caching for maybe things that
aren&amp;rsquo;t going to change so more static assets. Maybe you might want to change the Pokemon that&amp;rsquo;s in a gym, but the location of that gym is something that should and can be cached. He&amp;rsquo;s right now talking about caching on the server side, on
the application side, and not on the mobile phone. But I wonder if they&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about that later as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: It&amp;rsquo;s all cached and served through Google Cloud CDN. So when the Poke&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So he also mentions using a CDN, so a Content Delivery Network, which is really good because that means that if I&amp;rsquo;m in the Netherlands and I make a request to their servers, my request isn&amp;rsquo;t then going to be sent to a server in the US, because it&amp;rsquo;s going to be sent to one of the servers in my country or nearby. That means that the latency between my request being sent, and that request getting to the server, and retrieving that resource and back, is going to be a lot lower. So it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;hellip; This is a way to improve performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: The player catches the Pokemon, the GCLB sends the request to our GKE cluster. And we have a front-end service that sits behind Nginx reverse proxy. The request goes from the user&amp;rsquo;s phone through the reverse proxy, to one of these player, front-end services. We also have this thing called a Spatial Query Backend. It&amp;rsquo;s a cache by location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that is where we store the information that determines where a Pokemon is shown on the map, what gyms and Poke stops are around you, what time zone you&amp;rsquo;re in, or any other feature that is location-based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: Now, what happens when I hunt a Pokemon down and catch it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: When you catch a Pokemon, it sends the request to the front end, to the Spanner database, where your player entity is stored and it store it there. For catching Pokemon, that actually doesn&amp;rsquo;t go to the Spatial Query Backend. If you were, instead, if you were battling in a gym or adding lures to the Poke stop, that information is stored on the Spatial Query Backend, and&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Okay. So it sounds like the Spatial Query Backend is only storing data about the world, the Pokemon Go world that everybody can see. So people don&amp;rsquo;t need to know whether another person has caught a particular Pokemon. They just need to know whether there&amp;rsquo;s a lure on a Poke stop, or whether the gym is Team Mystic and things like that that everybody else can see. So there&amp;rsquo;s this segmentation of some data that is specific to the user, and other data that all users need to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: We also use Pub/Sub to send the message to a Pub/Sub topic, which is then used for analytics pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: He talks about a Pub/Sub model, which means that their architecture is event driven. So the traditional way that this is handled is by polling. So normally when an service is waiting for something to happen, it goes, and it sends a message and it checks. Basically like, &amp;ldquo;Hey, are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then when it finally gets a response that &amp;ldquo;Yes, we are,&amp;rdquo; then it can do something with that data. Instead what they&amp;rsquo;re doing as a Pub/Sub. So instead it waits for events. There is no constant polling, again, reducing the amount of traffic that&amp;rsquo;s going back and forth. And it just specifies criteria for what it is actually waiting for. And when that happens, after the services that require that event are subscribed, then that event is published to all of them. And then they can then do whatever they want with that event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: So, how do you ensure that when two people who are in the same geographic regions, see the same Pokemon data, and keep that relatively in sync, especially during the events?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: So it&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty interesting. Everything in our servers are deterministic. So even if players are on different machines, they&amp;rsquo;re sensitive to
different front-end services, if they&amp;rsquo;re in the same physical location, all the inputs would be the same and the same Pokemon would get returned to both users. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of caching involved and as well as precise timing, especially when the settings are changed and they need to be in sync across all the servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s very tricky, but it was very important for us that all the players feel like they&amp;rsquo;re part of this one shared world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely sure what he means when he says that it&amp;rsquo;s deterministic.I&amp;rsquo;m going to guess, and I have no relationship with Google or with Niantic, but I&amp;rsquo;m thinking that what he means is that when you&amp;rsquo;re catching a Pokemon, there is no request that&amp;rsquo;s being sent to the servers to say, &amp;ldquo;Hey, did I catch this?&amp;rdquo; Instead, there&amp;rsquo;s probably some sort of algorithm. This Psyduck is caught 80% of the time and appears 2% of the time. So 2% of the Pokemons that you&amp;rsquo;re gonna see appear in this area, are going to be Psyducks. And that&amp;rsquo;s also reducing the load going back and forth, right? Because it&amp;rsquo;s just the equation or the algorithm that determines whether you catch a Pokemon or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: This game data is of interest to our data science team. They use this for marketing purposes, for verifications. For example, we might want to say that this player, or players caught x millions amount of Pokemon during our Saturday Community Day events. So, it&amp;rsquo;s important that we have that information in an easily accessible manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: So there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of data here that they track. So I&amp;rsquo;ve got my distance walked, Pokemon caught, I&amp;rsquo;m at 18,878. Poke stops visited, total XP, start date. And then there are these medals as well. So, they look at things like, how far have you walked in total? So all of these things are data points that they store for every single user. No wonder they have such a focus on databases, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: As the events grow, like you mentioned, in some of these events, the traffic grows to millions of users per second. You also said&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Per second!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: &amp;hellip;of data is generated. How does the system scale when it comes to data pipeline?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: Yeah. So when there&amp;rsquo;s increase of transactions, there is increase of load
throughout the system with a lot of our data pipelines for things like BigQuery, one of that&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: I&amp;rsquo;m not actually sure she was saying millions of users per second, but that&amp;rsquo;s a little bit ambiguous. Maybe she meant millions of requests per second. And the way that they&amp;rsquo;re trying to do that is they&amp;rsquo;re reducing the size of those requests. If she means there are millions of concurrent users at any given time, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean that those users are all doing something at the exact same time. So I would have wanted to see exactly how many requests, to hear
how many requests per second they&amp;rsquo;re needing to deal with, or how many bytes per second are being sent over the wire. That would&amp;rsquo;ve been cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: &amp;hellip;Just works. Google Cloud will handle the increase in traffic without any intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: With that much traffic, obviously health of the system is critical as well. How do you monitor the health of the system during these massive events?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: So we use multiple monitoring systems, including Prometheus, Grafana, and Google Cloud monitoring. On a personal level, I actually prefer it to Google Cloud monitoring because it&amp;rsquo;s very simple to use&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: Whoo whoo! And they&amp;rsquo;re using Prometheus and Grafana &amp;hellip; Oh, this is entirely unexpected, but I&amp;rsquo;m actually wearing a Grafana shirt. So it&amp;rsquo;s really cool that they&amp;rsquo;re using Prometheus and it really, it makes sense, because they&amp;rsquo;re on a Kubernetes cluster and Prometheus and Kubernetes just go really well together. By the way, I work for Grafana, for context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: What are some of the expansions and improvements you&amp;rsquo;re looking to do in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: On the Google Cloud side of things, we are looking into things such as Agones and Google Game servers, and using that to see how we can make our game even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA: We wish you and the Niantic team best of luck for these enhancements. And this has obviously been super insightful for us, James. Thanks for joining me today and sharing your architecture with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JAMES: Yeah, thanks for having me. This was fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NICOLE: That was really good. So there were a few things that were mentioned there for how they&amp;rsquo;re scaling Pokemon Go, that I wrote down here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One, they use an event driven architecture and also a microservices based architecture, both of which are way more performant than the traditional methods.And the microservices based architecture will also let them scale up independently as demand increases as well. And they&amp;rsquo;re also using Cloud Spanner instead of Google Data Store, prioritizing global consistency, as well as high availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They front-load a lot of the static assets that are used by the application. And they&amp;rsquo;re being downloaded when the app is initially downloaded or installed onto users&amp;rsquo; mobile phones. That way they don&amp;rsquo;t have to keep serving the same data if it&amp;rsquo;s going to be used consistently. And when something changes, like a different lot of Pokemon, they release these patches that let you download a lot of those images so that when you catch those Pokemons, then you already have all that information on your phone. And on a related note, they&amp;rsquo;re employing a lot of caching. They talked about caching on the mobile app side, and on their server side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events are also staggered. So splintered realms sort of, because they&amp;rsquo;re happening
on different time zones, depending on where you live. And not completely simultaneously, regardless of the time in the part of the world where you&amp;rsquo;re from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re also using things like Prometheus, Grafana and Google Cloud Monitoring. They didn&amp;rsquo;t mention how they&amp;rsquo;re actually using multi-tenant versions of Prometheus like, maybe, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if they&amp;rsquo;re using Cortex or something like that, but that&amp;rsquo;s something that they should look into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they also mentioned potentially increasing the number of Google Game Servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really appreciated that behind the scenes look. I wish more companies would do this, especially for apps that I personally love and use. One thing that I&amp;rsquo;m really curious about though, is the testing side of it. Because testing an application of this scale and complexity, is another thing entirely from observability. And I would have wanted to know how they&amp;rsquo;re doing their performance and load testing. And whether they&amp;rsquo;re doing things like chaos engineering maybe, or reliability testing to improve the availability and reliability of their application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re still watching this, then chances are high that you like Pokemon and load testing as much as I do, which is a bit of an odd combination. And in that case, check out this video, on how I run chaos experiments using k6, Prometheus and Grafana. Thank you for joining me as I watched this awesome video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as they say in the Netherlands, (Dutch) Until next time! Bye!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s k6 Office Hours, I was joined by my colleagues &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/markjmeier&#34;&gt;Mark Meier&lt;/a&gt; and Simon Legander, front-end lead at k6, to talk about the new features that have come to k6 Cloud this year so far. Simon also gives us a sneak peek of all the cool features coming on the horizon&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke at the Performance Objective meetup to talk about how to use k6 and Grafana for beginners. I always enjoy talking to like-minded engineers, and I think sharing ideas in a meetup context is probably the best way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was really excited to have Hans Knecht on this week&amp;rsquo;s Office Hours. Hans works at Mission Lane, and is one of the biggest contributors to a k6 extension called k6 operator. k6 Operator lets you create a k6 custom resource object in Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this week&amp;rsquo;s k6 Office Hours, we attempted to steer into Halloween by talking about some of the most common performance testing issues we&amp;rsquo;ve faced in our careers as performance testing consultants. For this one, I had Tom Miseur join me to commiserate and swap stories.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s Office Hours, I wanted to talk about the intersection of Site Reliability Engineering and performance testing, so I decided to invite two people with different backgrounds from me to discuss it. Stephen Townshend is a performance engineer who recently changed jobs to become an SRE, and Daniel González Lopes is an SRE who had not had experience in performance testing before he joined k6. It turned out to be a great talk!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know that every new person to k6 does a Week of Testing? It&amp;rsquo;s a k6 tradition for new hires to spend their first week seeing firsthand what the experience of a new user of k6 is like. How quickly do they find the documentation? What issues do they get stuck on? Then, at the end of the week, the new employees do a presentation for the rest of the team to show their first impressions and findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s Office Hours, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/inancgumus&#34;&gt;İnanç Gümüş&lt;/a&gt;, one of the newest k6 team members, shares his presentation and his experience as a k6 beginner. Another colleague, Viktor Mihajlović, a Technical Customer Success Engineer, also shares some of the most commonly asked questions he&amp;rsquo;s heard on the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why I love to learn human languages, and what Esperanto sounds like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Grafana acquisition of k6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what performance testing is, anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether everyone needs to do performance testing, and my personal setup for this blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chaos engineering and Schrödinger&amp;rsquo;s Pokémon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an overview of the Grafana Labs projects landscape&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what k6 is, and how we would get started for free (k6 OSS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>How to make load testing scripts realistic</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20211014-realistic-load-testing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A good load testing script exercises the functions and components as specified in the requirements gathering phase while simulating real users as closely as possible. Here are a few ways to make scripts more realistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xz6drbGuUdI&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

      <title>Basics of load testing with k6 and Grafana in 20 minutes</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20211012-basics-of-load-testing-with-k6-and-grafana/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20211012-basics-of-load-testing-with-k6-and-grafana/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a video I pre-recorded in preparation for &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20211005-testing-with-k6-and-grafana-better-together/&#34;&gt;the first Grafana EMEA virtual meetup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gvounvDSDGg&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-June (just three months ago), k6 joined the Grafana Labs family. Many people didn&amp;rsquo;t quite understand what the connection was between k6 and Grafana, but I thought it made a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s Site Reliability Engineering book talks about 4 golden signals that we should measure in a system: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Load testing provides 3 of those (latency, traffic, and errors), but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show saturation, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t give us visibility into the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grafana brings observability. k6 brings data. They work really well together, which is why we&amp;rsquo;ve been using each other&amp;rsquo;s products for a few years now, before there was ever any talk of an acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about why k6 and Grafana are better together and also demonstrate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to run a simple script in k6 OSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to make sense of the results of a load test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test execution options: running locally, sending results to k6 Cloud, and running a test from k6 Cloud&amp;ndash; all triggered using the CLI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;two different integration options to bring k6 and Grafana together: the k6 Cloud Grafana data source plugin and Prometheus Remote Write&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

My part begins around &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ovqu_1aW3Sw&amp;amp;t=2720&#34;&gt;0:45:20&lt;/a&gt;, but I thought the other speakers&#39; parts were really fascinating as well!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this Office Hours, I invited my colleague Tom Miseur and friend Leandro Melendez, aka Señor Performo, to talk all about different criteria in performance testing, including non-functional requirements, SLAs, SLOs, SLIs, thresholds, and checks. Criteria at different levels is how we determine whether testing, including performance testing, has been successful, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand what they are and incorporate them into testing scripts and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re learning a new skill, there&amp;rsquo;s only so much that studying can do. The problem is that there&amp;rsquo;s still a big gulf between studying something and doing it yourself. The solution is having a mentor to bridge the gap&amp;ndash; someone who will let you shadow them while they&amp;rsquo;re executing tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made this video thinking about the me from over a decade ago who would have wanted to get the chance to look over a more experienced tester&amp;rsquo;s shoulder. In this video, I talk about how considerations for planning load testing, using a hypothetical use case for a real company: &lt;a href=&#34;https://wyrmwoodgaming.com&#34;&gt;Wyrmwood Gaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this first EMEA session of the Grafana Labs virtual meetups, I talked about how to use k6 and Grafana together to get the full performance picture for a software application. Observability, using tools like Prometheus and Grafana, lets us see what&amp;rsquo;s going on inside the application, and load testing, using k6, helps us get those insights earlier on in software cycles, such as during pre-production.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bill Rainaud is an inside account executive at k6, which means he talks to users and potential users of k6 every day. In this Office Hours, he explains how to get started with load testing using k6 Cloud, which is a SaaS platform for running and scaling up load tests on the cloud. We also answered a few frequently asked questions about k6&amp;rsquo;s capabilities and how to do correlation in k6.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My co-host &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I had invited Adron Hall from &lt;a href=&#34;https://hasura.io&#34;&gt;Hasura&lt;/a&gt; to come talk to us about how to load test a GraphQL API, but he was unable to come due to unforeseen circumstances. Luckily, Tom Miseur, who is part of the Professional Services branch of k6, was able to step in on very little notice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom has done a load testing engagement using k6 that involved Hasura, so he was able to tell us what it is and how it can be tested with k6. It turned out really well, thankfully!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight I did a webinar with Grafana Labs&amp;ndash; the first k6-related webinar since the acquisition. I was more than a little nervous to give it, because I knew I was introducing k6 to a lot of new users, but also to Grafana for the first time. I think it went pretty well! I was still quite relieved when it was over, however. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the webinar, I talk about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why it&amp;rsquo;s still a good idea to do load testing in pre-production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what k6 is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why k6 and Grafana together make sense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and how to integrate k6 and Grafana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s quite a bit of demo in it, and I also had the k6 CEO, Robin Gustafsson, join me for Q&amp;amp;A as a nice treat.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I gave a presentation at New Relic&amp;rsquo;s FutureStack conference about &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210730-schrodingers-pokemon/&#34;&gt;chaos engineering with k6 and New Relic&lt;/a&gt;. A few months ago, k6 got acquired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://grafana.com&#34;&gt;Grafana Labs&lt;/a&gt;, and so I wanted to redo it, but with the Grafana stack this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the result, and I think I like this iteration even better:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I presented this talk at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSgH3I8_ldk&#34;&gt;TestCon Europe 2021&lt;/a&gt; today, although the audio sync issues were not great, so I recommend you watch the video above instead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/grantyoung86/&#34;&gt;Grant Young&lt;/a&gt;, Software Engineer in Test at GitLab, joined &lt;a href=&#34;https://grafana.com/k6&#34;&gt;k6 OSS&lt;/a&gt; maintainer &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MStoykov&#34;&gt;Mihail Stoykov&lt;/a&gt; and me to talk about how GitLab uses k6. Apparently, they began using k6 internally some time ago, and because they like to eat their own dogfood and use GitLab to test GitLab, they also incorporated k6 into GitLab so that their users could reap the benefits, too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/USI_LeeBarnes&#34;&gt;Lee Barnes&lt;/a&gt; and I got connected because we are both speaking at &lt;a href=&#34;https://testcon.lt/&#34;&gt;TestCon Europe 2021&lt;/a&gt; this year, and I thought it would be nice to have a chat with him before the conference to get a sneak peek at what he&amp;rsquo;s presenting about: continuous performance testing. Lee is the CEO of &lt;a href=&#34;https://utopiasolutions.com/&#34;&gt;Utopia Solutions&lt;/a&gt;, and he&amp;rsquo;s been in the testing industry for decades, so I really appreciated his insights on where the industry is going.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tommiseur/&#34;&gt;Tom Miseur&lt;/a&gt; joined k6 at about the same time I did late last year, and we immediately hit it off because we both come from a performance testing consulting background AND we both had worked for different competing testing tool vendors before moving to k6. I was excited to have him on k6 Office Hours to talk about a topic we both had a lot to say about: how to debug load testing scripts, and specifically k6 scripts. We got a chance to do a bit of a show-and-tell of tools that we use that we use, and they are all independent of k6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wireshark.org&#34;&gt;Wireshark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://proxyman.io&#34;&gt;Proxyman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got to demo &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/benc-uk/k6-reporter&#34;&gt;a cool HTML reporting dashboard&lt;/a&gt; that Ben Coleman, a k6 user, created. While it&amp;rsquo;s not baked into the tool itself, it&amp;rsquo;s fairly straightforward to add it, requiring only two snippets of code that can be pasted onto any script.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, my colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gonzalezlopes.com/&#34;&gt;Daniel González Lopes&lt;/a&gt; joined me as a co-host on k6 Office Hours, and we interviewed &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kelvzhan&#34;&gt;Kelvin Zhang&lt;/a&gt; about his thesis at Imperial College London, using k6 to test microservices-based architectures. He created something called Kubedim, an application that intelligently applies non-uniform brownout theory to intentionally dim application requests for the purpose of improving overall availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a dense Office Hours to digest, but Kelvin really impressed us with his experiments and findings! It&amp;rsquo;s definitely an awesome use case for k6 and just a great one to watch for any site reliability engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Running a load test is half of the equation, and not having the right observability tools to see how your application responds to the load can sometimes flat-out invalidate a test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how to install open-source tools Grafana and Prometheus on a Kubernetes cluster in DigitalOcean and how a performance user could use them for increased visibility during a load test.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this episode of k6 Office Hours, I got the k6 Chief Technical Officer, Pawel Suwala, to give a bit of a behind-the-scenes of how we work at k6 and what we&amp;rsquo;re working on next. We talked about the methodology we use for building k6, the different teams we have, and exciting new features that are coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a presentation I gave at &lt;a href=&#34;https://newrelic.com/futurestack/speakers/nicole-van-der-hoeven&#34;&gt;New Relic FutureStack 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deploying an application to production is often like putting a pokémon in a box and hoping it manages to stay alive despite real-world chaos and potential outages. What can we, as testers, do to prepare applications for these situations before they go live? In this talk, I discuss chaos engineering concepts and demonstrates how to apply them by incorporating load tests with chaos experiments and setting up observability tools to watch it all happen. Because without observability, how can we tell whether Schrödinger&amp;rsquo;s pokémon is alive or dead?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the acquisition of k6 by Grafana Labs, the entire k6 team has been absorbed into the new, larger team that we&amp;rsquo;re suddenly a part of. Grafana Labs maintains a lot of projects, so I was very quickly overwhelmed with things to learn about all of them. Here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt to make sense of the Grafana Labs landscape, and perhaps it can help some of you as well:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s Office Hours, &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I talked about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/grafana/k6-operator&#34;&gt;k6 Operator&lt;/a&gt;, which is a open-source project that Simme created for distributed load testing with k6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 Cloud already offers a no-hassle distributed load testing experience, but for those who prefer to use their own infrastructure, k6 Operator allows the setup of a k6 test as a custom resource object that can be deployed along with a Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuous testing means verifying and improving software quality at all stages, including development. It can sound like something only large companies do, but it&amp;rsquo;s an approach I use even for this personal blog that you&amp;rsquo;re reading this on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every new blog post or change I make to this site automatically triggers the execution of a small test. This test, when run over time, lets me see whether changes I&amp;rsquo;ve made have been detrimental to site performance. Here&amp;rsquo;s a video on my setup:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;José Luis Latorre Millas, Developer Community Lead and Software Architect at Swiss Life AG, joined &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and me on k6 Office Hours to talk about how he personally uses k6 with Azure DevOps to add load testing to his team&amp;rsquo;s CI/CD pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to know José from the k6 Community Slack workspace when he mentioned that he would be presenting on k6 in a few meetups. I went to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HITJg03AQFo&amp;amp;t=112s&#34;&gt;his livestream with CrossDvlUp&lt;/a&gt; (Spanish) and enjoyed his approach, so I knew I wanted to have him on. It&amp;rsquo;s always great to have real users of k6 (both of the OSS and the commercial Cloud option) talk about how they personally use k6 and even what they found lacking in the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on k6 Office Hours, &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I were joined by two CEOs: k6 CEO &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinegustafsson/&#34;&gt;Robin Gustafsson&lt;/a&gt; and Grafana Labs CEO &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nopzor&#34;&gt;Raj Dutt&lt;/a&gt;. It was a little nerve-wracking to have two CEOs on the stream, but it did give us the opportunity to ask both of them pointed questions on Grafana Labs&amp;rsquo;s acquisition of k6, including any plans they have for how both companies could integrate better in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, during Grafanaconline 2021, &lt;a href=&#34;https://grafana.com/about/press/2021-06-17-grafana-labs-brings-modern-open-source-load-testing-to-observability-with-acquisition-of-k6/&#34;&gt;Grafana Labs CEO Raj Dutt announced&lt;/a&gt; the acquisition of k6&amp;ndash; the company I work for. What does this mean? Here&amp;rsquo;s a video I made to explain it all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/t1agJsLwrGE&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I have also discussed the acquisition twice on k6 Office Hours:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrDo2wMeV80&#34;&gt;once with our CEO, Robin Gustafsson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and another time with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWIB-myito&#34;&gt;both Robin and Raj, Grafana Labs CEO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DW: We unanimously agree it&amp;rsquo;s a positive thing. I myself am cautiously optimistic about the future of both k6 and Grafana Labs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kevinohashi&#34;&gt;Kevin Ohashi&lt;/a&gt; joined me and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/FloorDrees/&#34;&gt;Floor Drees&lt;/a&gt; on k6 Office Hours to talk about how he used k6 to &lt;a href=&#34;https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/&#34;&gt;benchmark the performance of WordPress hosting providers&lt;/a&gt;. He talks about the difficulties he ran into while trying to keep tests repeatable and consistent, and I also make some suggestions for how he could improve his load testing script for future comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of particular note for me in his results was how clearly the performance of the hosting providers varied depending on the location Kevin had selected for his load generators. One in particular showed a significant delay when a site was fetched from Sydney, indicating the possibility of a lack of a CDN server in that region. It made a great argument for load testing in the cloud, from different geographical regions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On this week&amp;rsquo;s Office Hours, &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I were joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinegustafsson/&#34;&gt;Robin Gustafsson&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of k6, to make a big announcement: k6 has been acquired by Grafana Labs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RrDo2wMeV80&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folks at Grafana Labs have been fans of k6 for a while, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been fans (and users) of their work since almost the beginning of k6. While a surprise to many, Grafana and k6 together is a combination that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read &lt;a href=&#34;https://grafana.com/about/press/2021-06-17-grafana-labs-brings-modern-open-source-load-testing-to-observability-with-acquisition-of-k6/&#34;&gt;Grafana&amp;rsquo;s press release here&lt;/a&gt; to hear more about this milestone.&lt;/p&gt;

Every new person at k6 goes through a week of testing, and Floor decided to spend her week of testing doing an accessibility review on the k6 Cloud web app and documentation. We talk about how accessibiltiy is an often-overlooked form of operational testing, and Floor shares specific tools that testers can use to make applications more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also discuss the k6 open source support program, which makes k6 free for open-source maintainers and regular contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on k6 Office Hours, &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I were joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/szkiba&#34;&gt;Iván Szkiba&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MStoykov&#34;&gt;Mihail Stoykov&lt;/a&gt; to talk all about extensions. Iván, who is a System Architect at NNG LLC, is the most active k6 extension creator outside of the k6 team. Mihail is a software engineer at k6, and one third of the k6 OSS team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked about the many extensions Iván has created for k6 so that he can incorporate k6 into his team&amp;rsquo;s daily testing activities, his considerations for creating extensions, and how he got started. Mihail also shares some inside information on why certain decisions were made about the way k6 is structured, and common mistakes he sees people make in their custom extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What Is Load Testing? - A real-world explanation</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210601-what-is-load-testing/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 20:23:17 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210601-what-is-load-testing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve made about 60 videos on load testing and application performance to date, but I realized that I&amp;rsquo;ve never made one defining load testing, which seemed like a glaring mistake. So, here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/cCFwqlcHkX8&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rough transcript below - though I went off script a few times:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing is a key part of making sure that an application performs well and reliably. But what IS load testing, anyway? In this video, I break it down for you in simple terms. And if you&amp;rsquo;re a family member or friend of mine trying to understand what it is I do for a living, thank you! This is for you too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;software-testing&#34;&gt;Software testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes a whole team to build software, but some roles are more visible than others. For example, pretend you want to build a bridge. Who do you need to build it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An architect to design the specifications of the bridge&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A liaison or representative to the gemeente or local council to clarify what the specifications ARE&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Builders who will physically build the bridge, who might need to hire subcontractors for various materials and services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone to double-check that what you&amp;rsquo;re building is up to code (testers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Someone to manage it all, and maybe a few more levels of team leads&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traffic enforcers to detour traffic away from the bridge while it&amp;rsquo;s being built&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So who is responsible for &amp;ldquo;building&amp;rdquo; the bridge? The answer is, everybody. Everybody has a part to play. Every part is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the same thing with software. When we think about building software, we often think about developers, but that&amp;rsquo;s not the full picture. Just like building a bridge, it&amp;rsquo;s a team effort. But I want to zoom in on one role in particular, because it&amp;rsquo;s the role I&amp;rsquo;ve had most often: load tester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, let&amp;rsquo;s go on a field trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;load-testing-on-the-field&#34;&gt;Load testing on the field&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this bridge look familar? This is the Sint Servaasbrug, and they SAY that it&amp;rsquo;s the bridge on the €10 note. It might be true, too, because it&amp;rsquo;s here in my current hometown of Maastricht, the Netherlands, where the European Union was founded in the Treaty of Maastricht. The name Maastricht means the crossing of the Maas, which is the name of this river here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s pretend the bridge hasn&amp;rsquo;t been built yet, and that we&amp;rsquo;re helping build it. Let&amp;rsquo;s put on our load tester hats. As a load tester, it&amp;rsquo;s our job to make sure that the bridge can support the weight it is intended to support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we know how much weight it&amp;rsquo;s intended to support? Well, the council or the rest of the team helping us build the bridge might have some ideas on that, or some building standards that we can use. That&amp;rsquo;s a good place to start, and we should definitely discuss that with them, but as a load tester, it&amp;rsquo;s also our job to question those requirements. Let&amp;rsquo;s do some research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the street leading up to the bridge. Remember, the bridge isn&amp;rsquo;t built yet, but maybe we can get an idea of the kind of traffic that the area gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things to watch out for or questions to answer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many people are walking?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many are on bikes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many are on bakfiets bikes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are vehicles allowed on this street, and if so, how many of them drive through?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do people tend to pass by in groups, or on their own?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing we can do is check other bridges. This is the Hoogbrug, another bridge across the Maas river. It&amp;rsquo;s not going to be an exact match for the kind of traffic we might expect on OUR bridge, but it might give us some ideas. So we can scout this out the way we did the street near our bridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One difference we can see right away is that this bridge has stairs on both ends. Our bridge isn&amp;rsquo;t going to have that. The stairs do have the lip to make pushing a bike up it easier, but it&amp;rsquo;s not as easy as riding through, and any heavier vehicles are out. And people are probably less likely to go up stairs than they are to walk up an incline. So we already know that this bridge will probably experience less traffic than our bridge, but it&amp;rsquo;s still good to take notes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, let&amp;rsquo;s head back home, write down our findings, and think about what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tying-it-back-to-software-testing&#34;&gt;Tying it back to software testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we learned was useful, but there are still a few things we don&amp;rsquo;t know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is 10 AM right now. But is that really the highest point of traffic during the day? To be really sure, we should really try to go back at different times. Maybe there&amp;rsquo;s an increased amount of traffic during lunch as people go to restaurants or back to their homes to eat. Maybe a horde of kids would go across our bridge after school to go home.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And we should think beyond that, too. Are weekends busier because more people are out? Or are weekdays busier because people are going to and from work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then there are some things that are seasonal. Maastricht happens to be in the part of the Netherlands that celebrates Carnaval, so sometimes that area looks like &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;. Carnaval involves a slow parade of people, bikes, and trucks through the bridge to the central town square, called the Vrijthof. That&amp;rsquo;s absolutely something we&amp;rsquo;ll have to plan for when testing our bridge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about the bridge this whole time, but as load testers, we go through the same process for software, too. What we&amp;rsquo;ve just done on our field trip is called a workload model. A workload model is describes the load profile for a given test scenario, and it involves determining &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; (the key transactions), &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; (the load distribution among the transactions) and &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; (timing of the load) to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a web application, for example, like a web site, we might try to look through analytics and monitoring tools to try to determine things like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many users access our site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which pages do they visit? Some pages are like pedestrians - they don&amp;rsquo;t have much comparative weight and aren&amp;rsquo;t complex to process. But other pages are like big old trucks, that involve many components of our application and are comparatively very intensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When do they visit the site? Is our site the sort of site people go to to work, or to avoid work? at weekends, or during the week?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there any seasonal events, like sales or holidays, that might drive MORE people to our site?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where are the users from? Are they in the same country that our application servers are located in, or are they quite far away? What sort of internet speeds do they have? What percentage of them use computers to access our site, and what percentage of them use tablets or mobiles?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was just a taste of the kinds of questions a load tester has to answer during the course of testing. There&amp;rsquo;s still a lot more to cover - for starters, we haven&amp;rsquo;t even talked about how to actually RUN the tests yet! I plan to make more videos going through typical activites in load testing in more detail, but for now, I hope that gave you a good idea of what load testing is. And Mom, I hope you know what I do for a living now. :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for watching!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I first heard of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/perftestnz&#34;&gt;Stephen Townshend&lt;/a&gt; because he happens to have gotten the same introduction to performance testing that I did&amp;ndash; our shared mentor, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/stijnschepers/&#34;&gt;Stijn Schephers&lt;/a&gt;. He has started a podcast called Performance Time, where he interviews performance engineers about a variety of topics. This week, it was me!&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed/episode/3pp3ZFFB8DyfUEtLRuLxGe&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;232&#34; frameBorder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We talked about how I got started, one of my biggest failures as a performance tester, chaos engineering, what we can do to improve diversity in tech, and why I think note-taking is a key skill for any performance tester.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, we had &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/odysseas_lam&#34;&gt;Odysseas Lamtzidis&lt;/a&gt; on the show to talk about &lt;a href=&#34;https://netdata.cloud&#34;&gt;Netdata&lt;/a&gt;, which is an application performance monitoring tool that prides itself on having the easiest setup ever. Odysseas admitted that it might not have all the bells and whistles of other monitoring platforms, it Just Works. I see this as being very interesting especially for testers like me, who just want to have something set up but might not want to be bothered by the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2021 10:48:55 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210524-end-to-end-guide-for-load-testing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://abstracta.us/blog/performance-testing/load-testing-guide/&#34;&gt;Abstracta blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://abstracta.us/blog/performance-testing/load-testing-guide/&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a public-facing web application, the odds are you should probably be thinking about load testing.  Any tester can (and should) add load testing to their repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional tests are often carried out with a single user&amp;rsquo;s experience of your application in mind, but what happens when hundreds or thousands of users are on your site at the same time? Load testing helps prepare an application for this eventuality by simulating that situation before the application goes live. That way, you have time to fix any issues you find, and there are no nasty surprises in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this guide, I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk you through the basics of the load testing process, which fits in closely with traditional functional testing phases as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning: &lt;em&gt;Why are we testing? What are we testing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing test scripts: &lt;em&gt;How are we testing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execution: &lt;em&gt;Running test scripts against the application.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysis and reporting: &lt;em&gt;What happened, and what do we need to fix?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planning-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;Planning for load testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the planning phase, the team gets together and determines what load testing will involve, including the objectives, scope, resources needed, and test scenarios. The deliverable for this phase is a test plan, but that can be as formal or informal as the team requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning for any testing is a team activity, and you&amp;rsquo;ll want to get input from all the stakeholders &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s anyone who is involved in or might be affected by the testing. The first thing you need to clarify is the reason for load testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why are we doing load testing?&lt;/em&gt; seems like a very simple question, but you may be surprised by the varying answers from your stakeholders. Their reasons may require different test scenarios, so it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to agree on the collective objectives of this load testing cycle so that expectations are set accordingly. A requirement is a concise statement of how an application should behave in a given situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phrasing objectives as nonfunctional requirements (NFRs) is a good way to formalize them. An NFR defines the desired state of the application and can includes performance thresholds that the team decides on. For example: &lt;em&gt;Logging in as a registered user must take no more than 3 seconds (90th percentile response time)&lt;/em&gt; is a requirement based on response time. Good requirements are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Agreed Upon, Realistic, and Timely).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some other things that should be decided on during this phase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scope&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;What are we testing?&lt;/em&gt; Deciding on a shared objective for load testing lets you narrow down what areas of the application need to be targeted. Make sure everyone is clear on what &lt;em&gt;won&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; be tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry Criteria&lt;/strong&gt;. What do you need to begin? This is the time to start thinking about resources that are required for testing, including the number of people who need to be involved, the time it takes to carry out the testing, and environment requirements (including test data). You don&amp;rsquo;t always need a separate testing environment to do load testing, but if you do, that should be discussed up front so that the DevOps team knows you can&amp;rsquo;t begin without an environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workload Modeling&lt;/strong&gt;. A workload model is a set of characteristics that describe the load you&amp;rsquo;re attempting to simulate. If you want your load testing to simulate registered users accessing your site, what does that entail? This might require you to look through your site analytics to determine which pages are visited most often and which application features are most commonly used, or arrive at an estimate if analytics are not available. Are most users visiting from their laptops at lunch on work days, or do they use your site from mobile devices after work? Are most of them located in the US or in Europe? You&amp;rsquo;ll want your scripts to match real load as much as possible, so take note of key characteristics that might have an effect on the traffic your application experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Server monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;. Which application components will be involved? You want to have a plan in place to have monitoring, alerts, and logs set up on every server that will be tested by your scripts. If your load testing tool shows performance degradation, you want to be able to have information to look through on the relevant servers to troubleshoot that issue. Keep in mind that any sort of monitoring adds some resource overhead, so decide as a team what information you absolutely need to track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test Scenarios&lt;/strong&gt;. Which situations do you want to recreate? A test scenario objectively describes the situation to be simulated. Do you want to recreate the load profile of a typical day, or one from a very high-traffic period, such as during a sale? Do you want to recreate a production outage? You can use analytics data to come up with parameters for your each test scenario such as duration, number of concurrent users or requests, ramp up period (how quickly the application went from 0 users to your highest number of users), or how &amp;ldquo;spiky&amp;rdquo; the load needs to be (how the number of requests per second fluctuates throughout the test).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything discussed in this phase should be written in some sort of a load testing plan, which could be a formal, multi-page document, an epic with many user stories, or a bunch of Trello cards. Use the tools your team already uses. The format isn&amp;rsquo;t important; formalizing the outcome of the discussions is what counts. The test plan makes sure everyone has the same intent with regard to the testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing-load-testing-scripts&#34;&gt;Writing load testing scripts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to start writing scripts! You&amp;rsquo;ve already front-loaded a lot of the important decisions to the planning phase, so all that&amp;rsquo;s left to do in this step is to implement the plan in the form of load testing scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tool-selection&#34;&gt;Tool selection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/tools_on_market.png&#34; alt=&#34;Different load testing tools on the market&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many load testing tools available on the market, and the reality is that you don&amp;rsquo;t always get to be the one to choose what you use. Often, companies have already made agreements with tool vendors for licenses before you begin your load testing, and it would be financially infeasible to switch to another tool. However, if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough that you can choose the load testing tool, here are a few considerations for assessing different tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;resources-and-costs&#34;&gt;Resources and costs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much does it cost? Does the pricing model allow for scaling usage up and down as necessary?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should you &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/what-to-consider-when-building-or-buying-a-load-testing-solution/&#34;&gt;build or buy&lt;/a&gt; an end-to-end load testing solution?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What technical skills or experience with tools does your team have? Who will be doing the testing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the load testing tool support the protocols and technologies used by the application?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How easy would it be for the team to learn this tool and/or scripting language?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the tool make it easy for multiple people to collaborate on the same script?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it integrate with other tools in the testing stack (for test management, test result analysis, server monitoring, team communication)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could you add this tool to your CI/CD pipeline?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the tool have an easy way of setting thresholds or SLOs for performance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are the test results displayed in usable reports, or does the tool integrate with existing data visualization tools you are using?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;support&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If something goes wrong, does customer support cost extra?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there ample documentation available online for getting started without help?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a community of users of the tool whose experiences you could learn from?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;scaling-up-load-testing&#34;&gt;Scaling up load testing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many virtual users or requests per second can a single load generator simulate using the tool?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many load generators would you need if you used this tool?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can the tool handle the amount of test data required by your tests?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you execute tests from different geographical locations, depending on your the location of your users?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the tool allow you to generate load from the cloud?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These questions are not exhaustive, but you can use them as a starting point for your comparisons of load testing tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this guide, I&amp;rsquo;m going to outline a basic script in &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io&#34;&gt;k6&lt;/a&gt; for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s open-source, so anyone reading this can download the tool and the script and try it out for themselves;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s written in JavaScript, which makes it easy to learn for front-end developers or testers who have used tools like Cypress, Puppeteer, or Playwright.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s capable of generating &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/testing-guides/running-large-tests/&#34;&gt;tens of thousands of users&lt;/a&gt; on a single machine, so it&amp;rsquo;s cost-effective even with load ramped up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the principles I discuss will be applicable to other tools. I highly recommend you conduct your own proof of concepts with several tools to come up with a tool that fits your particular situation, test scenarios, and company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;installation-and-setup&#34;&gt;Installation and setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re on a Mac, the easiest way to install k6 is to use Brew. Run &lt;code&gt;brew install k6&lt;/code&gt; from your terminal, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be ready to go in a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re on a different operating system, &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/&#34;&gt;check here for installation instructions&lt;/a&gt; that apply to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-basic-k6-test-script&#34;&gt;A basic k6 test script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A barebones k6 test script looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;k6/http&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; () {
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;https://test.k6.io&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This script sends an HTTP GET request for the URL &lt;code&gt;https://test.k6.io&lt;/code&gt;, which is a simple test site. If you copy that code to your favorite text editor and save it as &lt;code&gt;test.js&lt;/code&gt;, you can then run it with the command &lt;code&gt;k6 run test.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll get something like this in response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/k6-supersimple-run.png&#34; alt=&#34;A sample run of a simple local test in k6&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A sample run of a simple local test in k6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output above means that you&amp;rsquo;ve executed 1 iteration of your script with 1 virtual user from your local machine. The test run consisted of 1 HTTP request, which had a response time of 128.2 ms (&lt;code&gt;http_req_duration&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be tempting to start scaling up the test at this point, increasing the number of virtual users and the duration of the script. But there&amp;rsquo;s one problem with the script as it is: it&amp;rsquo;s not realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;making-a-test-script-realistic&#34;&gt;Making a test script realistic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of a load testing script is to simulate a real user who accesses your site. In most cases, that involves more than the simple GET request from the script above. Load testing scripts don&amp;rsquo;t have to mimic a real user &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt;, but they do have to be close enough so as to apply the same amount, shape, and distribution of the load on your application server. If your load testing scripts aren&amp;rsquo;t realistic enough, you may get false positives during testing and discover too late that there is a performance issue in an application component that your scripts didn&amp;rsquo;t test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways to make your scripts more realistic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;add-static-resources&#34;&gt;Add static resources&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a page has static resources like images and scripts that are retrieved by a browser automatically, make sure your script retrieves those too, as they will have an impact on the response times you get. Consider excluding static resources fetched from third-party providers unless you&amp;rsquo;ve gotten their permission to run a load test on their servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;set-cache-and-cookie-behavior&#34;&gt;Set cache and cookie behavior&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Review your load testing tool&amp;rsquo;s default cache and cookie management settings and change them, if necessary, to match the scenario you want to test. First-time visitors to a site won&amp;rsquo;t have resources cached locally, but repeat visitors may be retrieving resources from the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;add-think-time&#34;&gt;Add think time&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real users don&amp;rsquo;t usually fetch the same URL over and over again without stopping. They navigate to your site, then spend some time reading the contents of the homepage before they interact with the page again. Think time is the amount of time that a user spends “thinking”— that is, the delay between requests. Adding a think time that varies between 1 and 5 seconds, for example, prevents the application server from getting artificially bombarded by requests in a way that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t occur in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;using-different-user-paths&#34;&gt;Using different user paths&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user path is the flow of how a user interacts with the application. What pages do they visit? What information do they type in? So far, you&amp;rsquo;re only testing one request, but perhaps your users may be performing other actions. The workload model that you put together in the Planning phase will come into play here. Other actions like logging in or paying for items in a cart exercise different parts of an application than browsing does, so the load testing script should reflect the most common user flows through your system. In k6, this is done by adding scenarios, but other tools may call them thread groups or execution groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;adding-test-data&#34;&gt;Adding test data&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way that users don&amp;rsquo;t (typically) search for the same keyword over and over again and don&amp;rsquo;t all log into the same test account, a script shouldn&amp;rsquo;t use the same data repeatedly. This behavior could cause responses to be cached, leading to misleadingly quick response times, or increased error rates, in the case of multiple virtual users attempting to log into the same account. To prevent that, modify your script to take data from a CSV file instead, letting you add some natural variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;setting-test-parameters&#34;&gt;Setting test parameters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test parameters are the main characteristics of the test and include the number of users, ramp up, duration, and ramp down. They control the shape of the user load, which you can see when you plot the number of virtual users over time during the test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/k6-vusonly.png&#34; alt=&#34;The number of virtual users over time during a load test, as graphed in k6&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The number of virtual users over time during a load test, as graphed in k6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramp up is a period of time during which virtual users are gradually added, usually at the start of the test, and ramp down is when they are gradually stopped. For most applications, ramps are more realistic than all users clicking a link at exactly the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;setting-failure-criteria&#34;&gt;Setting failure criteria&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of simulating real users is determining what constitutes failures in user experience. You can incorporate failure criteria into scripts by adding response verifications, checks, and thresholds (such as those for response time or error rate). Building these into the script is a good practice to get into, because it defines the limits of acceptable performance from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggestions in this section are for general use, but there are many situations where taking the opposite approach would be more realistic. Spend some time thinking about what is &amp;ldquo;realistic&amp;rdquo; for your application and test scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your reference, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/fb74cd9769c8abf95eeb8765a49398cb&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s a k6 script&lt;/a&gt; that started from the basic script I showed earlier, but has been modified to be more realistic. That link includes a CSV file with login credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;executing-load-tests&#34;&gt;Executing load tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of writing the test script, you probably would have already executed small verification tests, called shakeout tests. It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to start with these shakeout tests on a new environment to make sure that both your test artifacts (your script and any other data files) and the environment are ready for full testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;running-the-test&#34;&gt;Running the test&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following along with the k6 script so far, all you need to do to run a load test is to execute the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;k6 run test.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This command will run the k6 script according to the test parameters set within it. The test will be executed locally. This is best used for shakeout tests, or if you prefer to run your load test on your own infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;realism-in-test-execution&#34;&gt;Realism in test execution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way can make executing load tests realistic is by matching the location of load generators to the physical location of your users. When you run a load test on machines in your data center, in the same network as your application servers, you will likely see response times that are significantly faster than your users would see. These false positives can look good on the report, but they don&amp;rsquo;t help you measure real user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running on the cloud is an easy way to make tests more realistic, especially if most of your end users are external to your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re following along with the k6 script, you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.k6.io/account/register&#34;&gt;sign up for an account&lt;/a&gt; with k6 Cloud (the first 50 tests are free). Since k6 itself is open source, you can also run it on your own cloud infrastructure, but using k6 Cloud is the most convenient way to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have an account, &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.k6.io/account/api-token&#34;&gt;copy your API token from here&lt;/a&gt;. Then, run this command in your terminal to give your local k6 installation permission to run on your account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;k6 login cloud --token &amp;lt;YOUR_K6_CLOUD_API_TOKEN&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are successfully authenticated, you can continue to run tests locally using &lt;code&gt;k6 run&lt;/code&gt;, but you now have the option of running on the cloud as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;k6 cloud test.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 will then begin to execute your load test, and you&amp;rsquo;ll see a screen like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/k6-cloud-run-output.png&#34; alt=&#34;Running a k6 test on the cloud&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the &lt;code&gt;execution&lt;/code&gt; mode is now &lt;code&gt;cloud&lt;/code&gt;, to remind you where you&amp;rsquo;re running the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, your test will run on the k6 AWS account, in the Ashburn region. However, you can override this and specify other regions, including percentages of your virtual user to run on each, using &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/cloud/creating-and-running-a-test/cloud-tests-from-the-cli#cloud-execution-options&#34;&gt;cloud execution options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analyzing-load-testing-results-and-reporting&#34;&gt;Analyzing load testing results and reporting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;rsquo;m listing analysis as a different step in the process from execution, the two often (and should) overlap. The output from k6 in the screenshot above contains a link to the dashboard on k6 Cloud, so that you can see the results of the test in real time, as the test is running. Monitoring the test in real time lets you immediately spot issues as they arise, and, if necessary, stop the test to fix them. If the test is being executed by multiple load generators, having a consolidated dashboard is helpful in giving you an overview of the entire test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![An example of the results after a load test in k6 Cloud](/assets/Finished k6 run.png)
&lt;em&gt;An example of the results after a load test in k6 Cloud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a good time to monitor the health of the application servers and the load generator servers, which you set up monitoring tools for during the planning phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A load test is only useful when it&amp;rsquo;s providing information about the application. If errors occur in large quantities, or if the response time makes it clear that a certain component has failed to handle the load, don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to stop the test. Your objective is to get the information you need to suggest performance improvements and solutions for any bottlenecks you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, you&amp;rsquo;ll run into issues you can&amp;rsquo;t solve or even identify during a test. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s useful to explore the data that you have after a test. k6 lets you create shareable links to dashboards so that you can involve relevant engineering teams who may be able to help you understand what happened and why. &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.k6.io/runs/public/f6ad87cec7a24a8c82e46c816e67c4b3&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of what that dashboard looks like&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some projects require formal documentation of test execution by way of a Test Summary Report, but in more agile teams, it may be enough to share the test results dashboard and some supplementary information about what type of tests were run and what problems were encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important part of load testing isn&amp;rsquo;t the execution itself; it&amp;rsquo;s what you do with the results. Communicating results clearly to stakeholders will make it more likely that performance issues are fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phases I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined here are a good guide for anyone starting with load testing, but I always recommend that you take what works for your situation and leave the rest. In reality, the phases overlap with each other considerably, especially in more modern engineering cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another activity I&amp;rsquo;ve not covered here, but one that I recommend, is adding load testing to your CI/CD pipeline. This continuous testing approach involves &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/testing-guides/automated-performance-testing/&#34;&gt;automating load testing&lt;/a&gt; so that it occurs in regularly, in parallel with other development and testing activities. Continuous testing is a great way to get more value out of load testing, and it ensures that performance is front-of-mind for everyone on the application team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy testing!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We were happy to welcome &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/serverlessmom&#34;&gt;Nočnica Fee&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/new_relic&#34;&gt;New Relic&lt;/a&gt; to k6 Office Hours. She very bravely volunteered to learn how to use k6&amp;ndash; live! Talk about pressure. But she handled it like a champ!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also talked about why observability is both particularly important and particularly difficult in serverless architecture. There will definitely be a part two at some point!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We managed to get two other folks from k6 to join our Office Hours: our CEO, Robin Gustafsson, and our Head of Customer Success, Mark Meier. We took advantage of the opportunity to discuss wishlist features for k6 and bug Robin about how likely each feature was to see the light of day!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning more about chaos engineering. In this week&amp;rsquo;s k6 Office Hours, I shared my experience as a tester getting started with Kubernetes, chaos engineering with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/simskij/xk6-chaos&#34;&gt;xk6-chaos&lt;/a&gt; and k6, and observability with &lt;a href=&#34;https://newrelic.com&#34;&gt;New Relic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210211-503-podcast/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This must be the month for trying new things, because I jumped into livestreaming with the first ever &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210205-k6-office-hours&#34;&gt;k6 Office Hours&lt;/a&gt; just a week ago, and this week I&amp;rsquo;m jumping into podcasting with &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme Aronsson&lt;/a&gt;, who&amp;rsquo;s also doing the Office Hours with me. There&amp;rsquo;s definitely safety (at least psychological safety) in numbers, because doing it with someone else makes me feel a little more brave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the podcast is presented by &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io&#34;&gt;k6&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;rsquo;s really just a fancy term for saying that we&amp;rsquo;re both employed by k6 and we&amp;rsquo;re recording and producing the podcast on company time. Unlike the Office Hours, which is heavily k6-focused, the podcast will be about software performance and reliability in general. Simme and I happen to have different and complementary skillsets (he comes from a developer background, and I come from a testing background, and I think that makes for an interesting combination of perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the first episode! It should also be available on your audio podcasting tool of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The first ever k6 Office Hours</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210205-k6-office-hours/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The k6 virtual office is open!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I heard about office hours was from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.notion.so/&#34;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; went in on this trend as well. The concept involves opening your virtual doors regularly to your community, to answer questions and share best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big part of being a Developer Advocate is talking &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; people, and even conferences these days are mostly pre-recorded. I kind of miss being able to interact &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; people. I miss the immediacy of &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt;. So I talked &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme Aronsson&lt;/a&gt; into doing a k6 Office Hours with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re both new to livestreaming, so there&amp;rsquo;s a lot that we&amp;rsquo;ve learned and will be improving in future videos, but here&amp;rsquo;s our first attempt!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week of Testing Wrap-up: My thoughts on k6 as a load testing tool</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20201217-week-of-testing-07/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20201217-week-of-testing-07/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to make a final wrap-up video for my &amp;ldquo;Week of Testing&amp;rdquo; with k6&amp;hellip; ok, so it&amp;rsquo;s actually three weeks later now, but I wanted to explore k6 a little bit more before I gave my opinion on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zVjLBp543E4&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s the audio version:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/0YgYqrPpEzEMSZIloeiQtC&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;232&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, k6, for being awesome enough to agree to this video series before knowing what I&amp;rsquo;d say. Gotta love a company that welcomes transparency and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cuándo JMeter no alcanza: Pruebas de carga simulando navegadores</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20201216-cuando-jmeter-no-alcanza/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 16 Dec 2020 18:18:23 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20201216-cuando-jmeter-no-alcanza/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Aquí está el video de mi presentación en JMeter Scripting Day, un evento organizado por &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeterenespanol.org/&#34;&gt;JMeter en Español&lt;/a&gt; el 31 de Oktubre, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/1KB8e2Ld08M&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Y la versión audio:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/1f17kzrbYmOxk8e65JBTQH&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;232&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;introducción&#34;&gt;Introducción&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hola a todos! Yo soy Nicole van der Hoeven, y soy performance tester. JMeter es una de mis herramientas favoritas porque es gratis, simple, y por muchos casos hace exactamente lo que quiero y no más. Sin embargo, como performers es parte de nuestro trabajo elegir la herramienta adecuada para cada proyecto, y hay que admitir que hay situaciones en que JMeter simplemente no es suficiente.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;amazon---ui--dev-tools&#34;&gt;Amazon - UI + Dev Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esto es el sitio web de Amazon.com. Tengo abierta la pantalla de Chrome Developer Tools, que me muestra las solicitudes (o requests) que componen la página. Cuándo vamos a la página, el navegador (Chrome en este caso) envia estas solicitudes para nosotros, pero eso occure en el fondo. Un usuario normal no las ve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jmeter---creando-un-script&#34;&gt;JMeter - Creando un script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo que JMeter hace es grabar estas solicitudes y replicarlas. Aqui vemos una ejecución de un usuario virtual de un script en JMeter. Cada solicitud tiene la respuesta y el tiempo de respuesta. Pero eso no nos da una idea completa del rendimiento de la aplicación. ¿Por qué?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Por que JMeter, como otras herramientas de nivel protocolo, tiene unas limitaciónes. La primera es que si hay javascript o otros script que deben estar ejecutado por el navegador, JMeter no los ejecuta. JMeter solo los descarga. El tiempo de respuesta mide la descarga, no la duración de la ejecución. Entonces, siempre habrá una diferencia entre los tiempos de respuesta en una prueba de JMeter y los tiempos de respuesta en práctica.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A veces esta diferencia no es tan importante. Pero hay más y más aplicaciones hoy en día que se componen principalmente de estos javascript. Por esas aplicaciones, simplemente no es posible hacer un script en JMeter porque la mayoría de la lógica de la aplicación occure en el navegador, no en el servidor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;flood-challenge&#34;&gt;Flood Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La segunda razón es que el aumento de la seguridad de aplicaciones conduce a solicitudes más complejas que incluyen parámetros dinámicos. Estos parámetros hacen que sea más difícil para un intermediario lanzar un ataque, pero también hacen que sea más difícil para nosotros scripters, porque tenemos que extraer información desde la última respuesta y ponerla en la próxima solicitud. Es posible, pero es la pesadilla de cada performance tester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podemos verlo en la aplicación de muestra &lt;a href=&#34;https://challenge.flood.io&#34;&gt;Flood Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. Ya no trabajo para Flood, pero todavía es un buen ejemplo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;correlación-en-jmeter---flood-challenge-script&#34;&gt;Correlación en JMeter - Flood challenge script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esto es mi script en JMeter, y vemos que hay muchos parámetros que he tenido que correlacionar. La solicitud para simular hacer clic en el botón &amp;ldquo;Start&amp;rdquo; necesita los parámetros authenticity token, step ID, y step number, que son dinámicos. El contenido de los parámetros cambian cada vez que usamos esta aplicación.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;la-experiencia-del-usuario&#34;&gt;La experiencia del usuario&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La tercera razón es que JMeter tampoco mide la verdadera experiencia del usuario. Solo mide la duración de la comunicación entre el navegador y el servidor, pero no mide cosas como la representación de elementos en la página web, ni el efecto de un script que dura mucho tiempo para terminar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eso es importante porque estas cosas afectan significativamente la experiencia del usuario. De hecho, Steve Souders, un conocido el la industría de performance, dice que &lt;a href=&#34;https://rigor.com/blog/80-90-of-load-times-are-spent-on-the-front-end-start-there/#:~:text=Start%20there.,-Written%20by%20Craig&amp;amp;text=Last%20month%2C%20Steve%20Souders%2C%20Google&#39;s,is%20spent%20on%20the%20frontend&#34;&gt;hasta 90% del tiempo de respuesta&lt;/a&gt; que experimenta el usuario está en la interfaz. Con este numero podemos estar ciertos que una prueba con una herramienta de nivel protocolo no va a poder encapsular el rendimiento final de una aplicación.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;developer-tools---lighthouse&#34;&gt;Developer Tools - Lighthouse&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entonces, ¿qué podemos hacer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lo más fácil es intentar de medir la interfaz durante una prueba de cargas. Mientras ejecutamos una prueba con JMeter, podemos ir manualmente a la aplicación web en Chrome para usar Developer Tools. Podemos usar la pestaña Lighthouse, que nos da más métricos del perspectivo del usuario y sugerencias para mejorar el rendimiento.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;webpagetest&#34;&gt;WebPageTest&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;También uso &lt;a href=&#34;https://webpagetest.org&#34;&gt;WebPageTest&lt;/a&gt; a veces. Eso tiene más opciones para ejecutar la prueba automáticamente varias veces desde un lugar que puedo elegir. Aún podemos elegir un dispositivo para simular la experiencia de un usuario en un iPad, por ejemplo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;herramientas-alternativas-para-pruebas-de-carga&#34;&gt;Herramientas alternativas para pruebas de carga&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tambien podemos elegir herramientas alternativas para ejecutar nuestras pruebas de carga. Lo que tienen en común es que fueron diseñadas para pruebas de automatización, y utilizan un navegador real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.selenium.dev/&#34;&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt; es probablemente la más popular de esas. Selenium WebDriver en particular. Es compatible con Ruby, Java, Python, C# y Javascript. El problema con Selenium es que puede ser muy pesada. En una machina probablamente podemos ejecutar cinco usuarios de Selenium, más o menos. Eso es importante si estamos tratando de simular miles de usuarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hay muchas herramientas basadas en Javascript que también podemos usar. Hay varias framework que se utilizan para adaptar Javascript y nodeJS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppeteer fue desarollado por Google. Tricentis Flood también ha diseñado Element que utiliza Puppeteer, pero con un enfoque en el rendimiento.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/microsoft/playwright&#34;&gt;Playwright&lt;/a&gt; es una creación de Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jest.io&#34;&gt;Jest&lt;/a&gt; fue desarrollado por Facebook&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mocha es otro framework que es la base para &lt;a href=&#34;https://cypress.io&#34;&gt;Cypress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todos esas herramientas son open source y gratis. También hay alternativas propietarias, pero prefiero las soluciones open source porque en la mayoría de casos hacen la misma cosa y se actualizan con más frecuencia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;element-script&#34;&gt;Element script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Esto es un ejemplo de la misma acción, hacer clic en el botón Start en la aplicación Flood Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otra ventaja de simulando navegadores en vez de simulando las solicitudes es que es más simple crear un script. No tenemos que saber cada parámetro. Solo tenemos que describir lo que queremos que cada usuario virtual haga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podemos ejecutar scripts usando estas herramientas al mismo tiempo que un script de &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org&#34;&gt;JMeter&lt;/a&gt; o &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatling.io&#34;&gt;Gatling&lt;/a&gt; o lo que sea, y también tenemos la opción de reemplazar los script de protocolo con estas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusión&#34;&gt;Conclusión&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Para resumir, JMeter y otras herramientas de nivel protocolo tiene algunas limitaciones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No ejecutan scripts del lado del navegador&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pueden ser más complicado correlacionar parámetros dinámicos&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No miden la experiencia final de un usuario&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Para solucionar estos problemas, podemos complementar pruebas de carga tradicionales, de nivel protocolo, como JMeter, con herramientas simulando navegadores. De este modo podremos tener una comprensión más completa del rendimiento total de la aplicación.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bueno, se acabó el tiempo, entonces los dejo aquí. Gracias por escuchar, y me disculpo por mi español. Gracias a todos!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week of Testing: Day 5 - The thing about learning in public</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20201128-week-of-testing-5/</link>

      <description>
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/quoOYnweKw&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I mentioned that I&amp;rsquo;d used the &lt;code&gt;constant-vus&lt;/code&gt; executor to recreate the stepped load profile. Well, the thing about learning publicly is that it also means making mistakes publicly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was kindly informed by a few of my new colleagues that &lt;code&gt;constant-vus&lt;/code&gt; was not the most optimal way to recreate the stepped load profile. &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; wrote up a little function so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to repeat myself so much, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ppcano_&#34;&gt;Pepe Cano&lt;/a&gt; and Pawel Suwala (the CTO of k6 himself) both told me nicely that using &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/running-k6#stages-ramping-up-down-vus&#34;&gt;stages&lt;/a&gt; would have been the better solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s chalk that up to a TIL (Today I Learned) and record that snippet here for prosperity (found in the k6 documentation linked above):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;k6/http&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;check&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;k6&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; {
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;stages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; [
    { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;30s&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt; },
    { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;1m30s&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; },
    { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;20s&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; },
  ],
};

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; () {

  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;check&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;res&lt;/span&gt;, { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;status was 200&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;) =&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt; });
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;);

      <title>Week of Testing: Day 4 - Load profiles on k6</title>

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jDmMmc75RRM&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;k6 has a cool feature where even if you start a load test locally via the CLI, you can still stream the results to k6 Cloud. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting compromise between debugging a test locally (and therefore not paying for cloud infrastructure) and sharing results for load tests run on the cloud. It worked seamlessly, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to see how to recreate a specific load profile that I commonly use - the stepped load profile. In JMeter, I typically do this with a plugin - the jp@gc Ultimate Thread Group is my thread group of choice. So, I created it in JMeter (I love that it shows a little image of it as well, while you&amp;rsquo;re building it) and then attempted to recreate it in k6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely had to look at the k6 documentation for this. I used the &lt;code&gt;constant-vus&lt;/code&gt; executor for this, but k6 has &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/scenarios#executors&#34;&gt;several other executors&lt;/a&gt; to choose from, and it worked as well as I had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, my experience with k6 has been positive. Things are well-documented, and they just work out of the box. No plugins necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had my fun playing around with k6 Cloud, the SaaS component. For Day 3, I thought it was time to jump into the heart of k6: k6 the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/loadimpact/k6&#34;&gt;open source load testing tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First impressions: logging was a little sparser than I expect, coming from having used load testing tools that just do this for me automatically. I think one of the first things I&amp;rsquo;ll do with k6 is to create my own little &amp;ldquo;load testing starting script&amp;rdquo; that I&amp;rsquo;ll always use, with all of the appropriate logging already set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I was really impressed with how quickly it installed. If you scrub over to the timestamp &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5tteMKZUqk&amp;amp;ab_channel=k6&amp;amp;ts=106&#34;&gt;1:46&lt;/a&gt; in the video, you&amp;rsquo;ll hear that I was actually expecting to have to speed up the installation process while editing to save time, but the installation actually finished before I could say that I was going to do so. By my count that was 7 seconds between hitting enter in my terminal and the download finishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t help but compare that to &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org/&#34;&gt;JMeter&lt;/a&gt;. JMeter is honestly probably my go-to load testing right now&amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s not good for absolutely everything, but it&amp;rsquo;s the tool that I reach for when I &amp;ldquo;just want to test this one thing&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it for years, and it&amp;rsquo;s the tool that I know the most. But one of the issues with JMeter is that there&amp;rsquo;s so much to do before it&amp;rsquo;s actually usable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you even open JMeter, you need to install Java, and when I first started in load testing, I spent a long time wrestling with getting setting the Java environment variable in Windows before my computer would even recognize that Java was installed. Then you need to install JMeter&amp;ndash; but any JMeter tester will tell you that there are some plugins that you just can&amp;rsquo;t do without, and that really you should always install. That&amp;rsquo;s why there are so many &amp;ldquo;best plugins in JMeter&amp;rdquo; lists (&lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20200414-aaf11&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s my top 3&lt;/a&gt;)&amp;hellip; because most of them are necessary, but you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know that if you&amp;rsquo;re new to JMeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that k6 starts up in 7 seconds is&amp;hellip; shockingly good.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week of Testing: Day 2 - Comparing tests against a baseline</title>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2 of my Week of Testing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I ran my first load test on k6, and actually set up the thresholds wrong. I still maintain that there are some UI improvements that could still be made in that area, and that feedback was well-received. Apparently I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one who has made the same mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I learned that on k6, you can actually set one test to be a baseline. There&amp;rsquo;s so much I want to say on this topic - that&amp;rsquo;s probably a whole blog post there - but for now, suffice it to say that having a baseline test to compare succeeding tests to is a key to a successful round of load testing. I was happy to see that k6 thinks so too, because that functionality is built into the UI by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think that being able to schedule a test regularly is fantastic for practicing Continuous Testing. Of course, teams already using CI/CD pipelines would probably get the most benefit out of running load tests using the command line rather than through the UI, but it&amp;rsquo;s nice to know that scheduling is an option in the UI as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my first real day of testing with &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io&#34;&gt;k6.io&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to jump right in and figure out how to run a load test on k6 Cloud. k6 has documentation on this, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t use it for this test, since the point of a week of testing is to record how easy the product is to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My verdict: I&amp;rsquo;m pleasantly surprised with how easily everything went. Is it just me, or was that AWS startup time exceptionally fast? I&amp;rsquo;m used to AWS taking at least a couple of minutes to provision a machine, but this seemed to start up almost instantaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week of Testing: Intro</title>

  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zcYeboT5FYE&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was my first day at &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io&#34;&gt;k6.io&lt;/a&gt;! I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve joined as their newest Developer Advocate for Performance Testing. k6 is a company I&amp;rsquo;ve had my eye on for a while, even (or maybe especially) when I was working for a competitor, &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io&#34;&gt;Tricentis Flood&lt;/a&gt;. I always admired k6&amp;rsquo;s stance on open source, their involvement with the developer community, and the slick web app that brings load testing into the hands of many developers and testers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a load tester, I try to be tool-agnostic. I have to admit, though, that I do have a strong bias towards opensource tools. I joined Flood because of their focus on tools I already loved like &lt;a href=&#34;http://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi&#34;&gt;JMeter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatling.io/&#34;&gt;Gatling&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://element.flood.io&#34;&gt;Element&lt;/a&gt; (based on Puppeteer). (And Selenium, but it&amp;rsquo;s a stretch to say I love Selenium.) But these are tools I&amp;rsquo;ve used for years, most of them from even before I joined Flood. What kind of load tester would I be if I could only really talk about scripting in a handful of tools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I thought it was time for a change, and k6 was the first and only company on my list for a couple reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/loadimpact/k6&#34;&gt;The free and open source tool k6&lt;/a&gt;, which recently crossed over to 10,000 stars on Github, is often touted as the developer&amp;rsquo;s load testing tool of choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;k6&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/cloud&#34;&gt;cloud offering&lt;/a&gt; integrates seamlessly with the OSS tool, and it adds some killer features like performance insights that add real value to teams wanting to scale their load tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The k6 team is incredibly responsive to the needs of their community. Unlike most companies, where only marketing, sales, and customer support people talk to customers, k6 developers are active on GitHub, social media, and other blog sites. Everyone is passionate about what they&amp;rsquo;re building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roles in testing are changing, and the lines between tester and developer are blurring. Developers who don&amp;rsquo;t test are going to become just as obsolete as testers who don&amp;rsquo;t develop. I see k6&amp;rsquo;s popularity among the developer crowd as a good opportunity for me to sharpen my coding skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had to see for myself whether k6 was actually as good as it seemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, it turns out that k6 has a tradition of a &amp;ldquo;Week of Testing&amp;rdquo;, where every new member of the k6 team, regardless of role, spends their first week putting the product through its paces. Every part of the whole k6 solution (Cloud and OSS tool) is fair game, and the goal of the Week of Testing is to present feedback to the team at the end of it, while the new member&amp;rsquo;s eyes are fresh. When they told me about it, they said &amp;ldquo;We want to see you learn the tool on your own to see what parts are difficult to figure out.&amp;rdquo; To which I responded, &amp;ldquo;Challenge accepted!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to not only give a presentation at the end, but also to video the process for posterity&amp;rsquo;s sake&amp;hellip; and, let&amp;rsquo;s face it, to impress my new managers and coworkers with my dazzling work ethic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Get the company&amp;rsquo;s name right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first video, I share the differences between k6 vs. k6 Cloud vs. Load Impact!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/how-to-become-a-load-tester&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/how-to-become-a-load-tester&#34;&gt;Originally posted here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing can be a pretty intimidating field to get into, but it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get started. Here are some concrete steps you can take to start learning how to load test from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, Flood co-founder Tim Koopmans and I teamed up at Tricentis User Conference 2020 to talk about the essential ingredients for load testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_R2dmEmtO48&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;background-required-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;Background required for load testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing can be quite technical. It involves not just the ability to use different programming languages to create load testing scripts but also familiarity with software engineering practices, DevOps, application infrastructure, site reliability, and networking. A good load tester needs to be able to understand the basics of how an application works and how different components interact with each other. It&amp;rsquo;s common for a load tester to work on applications employing a variety of technologies, so staying up to date with recent technological trends and switching seamlessly from one language to another, or from one platform to another, is of utmost importantance. This technical side of load testing might make you think that a load tester needs to have formal studies in computer science and several years of experience in software testing. The reality is that there are many load testers who stumbled into the field from wildly unexpected backgrounds. So you might think load testing looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/how-to-become-a-load-tester01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&#34;https://unsplash.com/@wocintechchat?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&#34;&gt;Christina @ wocintechchat.com&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://unsplash.com/s/photos/meeting?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&#34;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And sometimes it does. But it more often looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/how-to-become-a-load-tester02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You see, load testing is an interdisciplinary field. So much of the job involves talking to people. Sometimes the requirements for a project are not clear, and someone needs to talk to the both the business and the developers to make sure that nonfunctional requirements are clarified. A load tester is a detective, tracing a request as it goes from one application component to another, coordinating with different application teams. A load tester is a scientist, using the scientific method to design experiments that yield the results. A load tester is a statistician, making sense of a jumble of data and seeking correlations between variables. A load tester is a public speaker. Even when the actual load testing has been completed and the report has been sent, a load tester makes sure all stakeholders understand the report so that the results can be used to make meaningful changes to improve application performance. All these tasks require a mishmash of skills and competencies that can be difficult to find in just the field of computer science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take our backgrounds as anecdotal examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim grew up and currently lives in a small country town in Australia, and he joined the military straight after school. He later developed a love of automating things, which led him first to use tools like perl to scrape websites and try to win bids with early versions of ebay, and then later to starting a performance engineering consulting career and co-founding Flood itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I, Nicole, grew up in Metro Manila in the Philippines (which has 14,000 more people per km2 than Mumbai does). I learned English as a foreign language in school, and I have a university degree in Economics. When I discovered load testing, I had a job in a completely different field– I was working for an airline and making sure engine components were properly maintained and repaired. My love for gadgets and technology took me down an 8-year rabbit hole involving doing performance consulting for clients across a variety of industries in Australia and the Netherlands. At Flood, I help customers around the world improve their application performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, Tim and I came from very different backgrounds and different parts of the world. Neither of us knew what load testing even was when we started working. Neither of us got formal instruction in load testing. But somehow, we still both ended up becoming load testers at Flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;reasons-to-become-a-load-tester&#34;&gt;Reasons to become a load tester&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why become a load tester? Here are some practical reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;load-testing-is-cool&#34;&gt;Load testing is cool&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little-known fact about load testing is that it can be really satisfying to be involved in big-name projects that end up going live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have heard of Flood. But even if you haven’t, we’re sure you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with the results of load testing done on Flood. In the last few years, we have been helping Hotstar, one of the largest streaming services in the world, load test their systems in preparation for the Indian Premier League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hotstar uses an open-source tool that we support, Gatling, to create scripts to simulate users tuning in to watch cricket games. Then, they use Flood to create a “Game Day” simulation. They scale up those load tests and run 5 million users on thousands of machines in the cloud. We help them coordinate execution, spot problems quickly with real-time results from all those machines while the test is still running, and identify bottlenecks so that they don’t occur in production, when India’s playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a load tester, you&amp;rsquo;ll definitely be working with brands you recognize and love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;load-testing-can-pay-well&#34;&gt;Load testing can pay well&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I said this would be a practical list, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are 261,768 practical reasons. The average performance engineer’s salary is 71% more than that of an average software tester in India, according to Payscale.com. We all know that money isn’t everything, but this is a clear signal from the market about the importance of performance-related skills. Adding load testing to your CV as a tester makes you more attractive to employers. It’s a great way to differentiate yourself in an over-saturated market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;load-testing-can-literally-take-you-places&#34;&gt;Load testing can literally take you places&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then there are the side benefits of being in load testing. The photos above are real ones from the Flood team. That’s me on the upper left, exploring a castle in Belgrade, Serbia, and that’s Tim in the bottom right, taking a photo in San Francisco, USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/inside-the-career-of-a-digital-nomad-is-a-life-on-the-road-right-for-you&#34;&gt;We’re a fully distributed team on Flood&lt;/a&gt;, which means we can work from anywhere. Flood is a web app, so you don’t need to install anything– I’ve been known to start load tests from my iPad in a café. Load testing on the cloud frees you from being tied to running tests from the office. You can start load generators when you need them and shut them down when you don’t– all from a web browser. It’s a job that can come with a great work/life balance, if you find the right company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing can also be a great way to move to another country. It’s what’s allowed me to move to other countries– twice. In Australia, the average performance engineer’s salary is AU$108,053, or over 5.6 million rupee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it’s clear that there are some pretty good reasons for you to become a load tester. I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk you through the practical steps to become a load tester. You may not be an expert by the end of this, but I hope I can convince you that you can get started in load testing whether your background looks like Tim’s or mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;load-testing-adds-real-value&#34;&gt;Load testing adds real value&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the trite, but absolutely true reason: Everyone fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a load tester, you are a gatekeeper of quality. What you do directly affects revenue and customer experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance is an aspect of software that is often overlooked, but it’s only becoming more important in a world where everything is going online. People are being born who have never known what it’s like not to have the internet, and consumers in general expect applications to be responsive and stable. Would-be customers who can’t get an e-commerce site to load within 3 seconds may switch to a competitor’s site, and we all know there are many of them. Performance-related outages can be seriously damaging to a company’s reputation, and social networking amplifies customer dissatisfaction by effectively giving everyone a megaphone to complain into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software functionality is still important. However, if an online store goes live with no critical functional defects, but it fails when the 100th person logs into it, or it takes 10 seconds to load the homepage, can you really say that it was ready for production?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing is a crucial part of ensuring software quality, and quality is the responsibility of everyone on a team, even if the word “performance” isn’t in your job title.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-essential-ingredients-of-a-load-test&#34;&gt;The essential ingredients of a load test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing is like cooking a meal. This is one of Tim&amp;rsquo;s favorite dishes, aloo matar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/how-to-become-a-load-tester07.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cubesnjuliennes.com/aloo-matar-recipe/&#34;&gt;Cubes n Juliennes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can approach cooking as a science. There are recipes with a list of ingredients, a precise measurement of how much you need for each, and a procedure for creating the dish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you can also look at cooking as an art. Cooking the same dish over and over again will give you an experience in working with those ingredients that a novice cook won’t have. There’s room in cooking for adding one ingredient, changing the quantity of another, or just trying something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A master chef knows how to use both the science and the art to create something delicious. But you don’t HAVE to be at that level in order to cook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone can cook. If you know how to follow a basic recipe, you may not create a masterpiece, but if you’re like me and you haven’t had lunch yet, you’ll still end up with something you’ll eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here’s the recipe for load testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I prefer kadai paneer myself, but aloo matar requires, among other things, peas. And so does load testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P is Preparation&lt;/strong&gt;. To prepare for a load test, you need to get your ingredients ready. You need to decide what it is you want to test, why you’re testing it, and how. You write load testing scripts that will simulate real users as closely as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E is Execution&lt;/strong&gt;. This is when you do the actual cooking. You run your load tests and scale them up according to your requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A is Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;. You figure out whether the dish you created is edible. You determine how your application servers responded during the load test, and decide if that’s acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation – Execution – Analysis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;preparing-for-a-load-test&#34;&gt;Preparing for a load test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As far as the World Cup is concerned, it is a process. We don’t want to jump to the 50th floor straight away. We must start on the ground floor.” - Sachin Tendulkar, via &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/22538610/world-cup-final-dream-tendulkar&#34;&gt;ESPN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing doesn’t start with writing a script. Load testing starts with building a foundation for later tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/how-to-become-a-load-tester08.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of that foundation is asking WHY. Why do you want to do a load test? Has there been a performance-related issue before? Are you trying to determine whether an application is ready to go live, or is it already live, and you just want to improve its performance? What type of application do you want to test?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHOM are you cooking for? I think you’d cook differently for yourself than you would for Sachin Tendulkar. What do your end users typically do on your site? Where do they come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are questions that need to be answered before you think about scripting. Here are some resource for planning your load tests:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/start-with-why-how-to-write-requirements-for-api-load-testing&#34;&gt;Start with Why: How to write requirements for API load testing&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/how-to-write-a-test-plan-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;How to write a test plan for load testing&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/ebooks/api-load-testing/scripting-an-api-load-test&#34;&gt;Selecting a tool for load testing&lt;/a&gt;
Generating a load testing script without coding: &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/overview-of-flood/scripting-your-load-test&#34;&gt;Getting Started with Test Builder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;execution-of-a-load-test&#34;&gt;Execution of a load test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we’re ready to start cooking. This is the Execution phase. You’ll need a machine to use as a load generator. Depending on the number of users you want to run with, you may need more than one machine. You might be tempted to run a load test on your laptop, or on a bunch of machines you have lying around, but that introduces new variables that may affect the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/how-to-become-a-load-tester09.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://unsplash.com/@suicide_chewbacca?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&#34;&gt;Ashwini Chaudhary&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://unsplash.com/s/photos/indian-food?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&#34;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any good cook, you’ll also need to make sure you have all your ingredients handy. In load testing, that means making sure your scripts and test data files are ready to be executed on every load generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these problems – provisioning a load generator and transferring files over to them – are solved pretty easily by running on the cloud using something like Flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing and executing your load test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where should you run your load tests? A look at demand, hosted, and on-premise infrastructure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analysis-of-results&#34;&gt;Analysis of Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last part is Analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/how-to-become-a-load-tester10.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.finedininglovers.com/recipes/brunch/potato-pakoras-yogurt-sauce&#34;&gt;Fine Dining Lovers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty crucial moment, because this is when you figure out whether what you cooked was delicious or not. Unfortunately, in load testing, it’s not always easy to tell how your test went. It’s like this photo of pakora (onion is my favorite kind). It’s kind of hard to say what expression that is in their faces. Is it disgust? Or is the pakora so yummy that they just can’t wait to eat more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing typically generates a LOT of data. You’d have to go copy every single file from every load generator you used. But can you imagine the hundreds of load generators that Hotstar used? Of course they didn’t manually copy those files. Instead, they used Flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Flood, we show real-time graphs as you’re running the test so that you can tell immediately whether transactions are failing or whether a server has stopped responding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the test, you can also compare this data to previous tests to spot trends, or even create your own dashboards using an analytics engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/results-analysis/metrics-during-test&#34;&gt;Real-time metrics during your load test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/results-analysis/archived-results&#34;&gt;Downloading results and logs after the test&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-that-it&#34;&gt;Is that it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’ve prepared for a load test, you’ve executed a load test, and you’ve analysed the results from the load test. Congratulations, you’re a load tester! By following this recipe, you’re already doing better than many people, and you’re certainly doing a lot better than those who do not run any load tests at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cool thing about load testing, though, is that this is just the beginning. There’s always room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/how-to-become-a-load-tester11.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://popupcity.net/observations/dabbawalla-hot-lunch-delivery-by-mumbais-fastest/&#34;&gt;Pop Up City&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dabbawallas are people who deliver hot lunches, and while the concept is not new, the implementation in India is particularly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these dabbawallas, having the meals prepared is not the end of the job. Once the food is ready, it needs to be packed into lunchboxes, picked up, separated according to destination, put on trains, and delivered. Later, the empty lunchboxes are picked up, and the system works in reverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It turns out that this is actually a pretty sophisticated system. In fact, it’s been estimated that only one tiffin every two months is not delivered. That’s equivalent to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170114-the-125-year-old-network-that-keeps-mumbai-going&#34;&gt;Six-Sigma quality rating of 99.9999999%&lt;/a&gt; (that’s nine nines) or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dabbawallas didn’t get that rating just by delivering quickly. They did it by being consistent and reliable. They did it by having a process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you see the benefits of running a load test, you may also start to understand that the real value of load testing is not in a test that you run once whenever you think of it. Imagine having the benefits of a load test tied to your development process, so that it is automated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an advanced topic, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/load-testing-in-devops-pipelines-with-azure-and-flood&#34;&gt;adding your load testing&lt;/a&gt; to your team&amp;rsquo;s Continuous Integration/Continuous Development pipelines such as sets up a repeatable process that reaps benefits far into the future, not just whenever official load testing activities are carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/continuous-integration/what-is-continuous-integration&#34;&gt;Continuous Integration with Flood&lt;/a&gt;: Integrating Travis CI, Circle CI, and Jenkins&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s the recipe for becoming a load tester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preparation – Execution – Analysis.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Preparation&lt;/strong&gt;, you determine why you’re testing and what tool best fits your needs. We showed you how to use Element, but there are many open source tools out there. Don’t get overwhelmed by scripting– a lot of times it can just mean replacing a URL with the one YOU want to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Execution&lt;/strong&gt;, you run a baseline test that will serve as a point of comparison for future testing, choose the number of users and the number of regions you want, and then you run your test. Running on the cloud is the easiest (and usually cheapest) way to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;, you view the results in real-time, compare historical performance to see trends, and share reports to stakeholders so that your team can make changes to your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also talked about the bonus topic of &lt;strong&gt;CI/CD&lt;/strong&gt; and how you can incorporate load testing into your pipeline to get a continuous feedback during your development cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim and I started in very different places and had different experiences before we discovered load testing. But eventually, we ended up on the same path, and that’s what we’ve outlined for you here. We hope that this convinces you that load testing doesn’t have to be complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You absolutely don’t need to be an expert to run a load test. Even if you don’t think you’ll get all these steps right, a load test that is less than ideal is still better than no load testing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, anyone can be a load tester with the right attitude and the right tools.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I joined other performance and testing engineers in this online panel at Testing Talks Online about load testing best practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.testingtalks.com.au/presentations/lifting-the-lid-on-performance-testing-best-practices-from-leading-companies&#34;&gt;Testing Talks Online site&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance testing is an essential part of the quality assurance function. However, across the industry the great majority of companies still struggle to master and execute a successful performance testing strategy that produces measurable results.
In this panel discussion, Cameron Bradley will host some of the best performance engineers in the world. The panel will discuss how we as quality assurance experts and performance engineers can better understand performance testing, the value of performance testing and how world leaders are approaching and succeeding with performance testing as part of the delivery life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/how-to-write-a-test-plan-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/how-to-write-a-test-plan-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People often start load testing by creating a script in their favorite load testing tool, but good load testing starts before that. Planning a load test may seem like a tedious exercise, but it is essential to ensuring the success of your testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A test plan should answer why, what, who, when, and how the testing will be carried out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good test plan, particularly for load testing, includes the following components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Requirements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scope&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Entry criteria&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Workload modeling&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test doubltes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test Scenarios&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll dive into each of these, but first, a note on the format of a test plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;test-plan-format&#34;&gt;Test Plan Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test plans have been traditionally presented as a document, but there&amp;rsquo;s no hard-and-fast rule. Instead, the length of a test plan, and the level of detail it goes into, should be tailored for the complexity of the project and the backgrounds of the stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams using Agile methodologies may not have a formal test plan at all, but I would argue that all teams should still have some sort of plan, whether it&amp;rsquo;s a Word document or a list of bullet points. Written plans clarify and communicate intent, and testing can be an expensive and fruitless exercise without a consensus on its intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical documentation can be difficult to digest and understand, and that&amp;rsquo;s dangerous when it comes to software development and testing, where it&amp;rsquo;s imperative that all stakeholders are on the same page about the state of an application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul McLean, a performance engineer, has a creative solution for this. He creates a companion video for every technical report, giving stakeholders the option to read the written report for details but watch the video for a more high-level and nuanced explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of a companion video he created for a test plan:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FJj_7nyV3Ak&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything starts with requirements. Until requirements are identified, load testing can only ever be aimless and explanatory, and any performance bottlenecks spotted will be incidental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirements inform every step of the load testing process. Why are we doing load testing? What exactly do we want to test? How will we know when a test has passed or failed? How will we know if application performance is good enough to go into production? What does “good enough” mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is such an important part of the planning process that I felt it deserved its own blog post. See it here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/start-with-why-how-to-write-requirements-for-api-load-testing&#34;&gt;Start with Why: How to Write Requirements for API Load Testing&lt;/a&gt;. Even though I specifically mention API load testing, the principles apply to load testing in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scope&#34;&gt;Scope&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Flood, we use a product development methodology called &lt;a href=&#34;https://basecamp.com/shapeup&#34;&gt;Shape Up&lt;/a&gt; to keep us on track as we build new features. Projects in Shape Up are called &amp;ldquo;shaped work&amp;rdquo;, and one of the basic properties of shaped work is that it is bounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;shaped work [also] indicates what not to do. It tells the team where to stop. There’s a specific appetite—the amount of time the team is allowed to spend on the project. Completing the project within that fixed amount of time requires limiting the scope and leaving specific things out.- Ryan Singer, &lt;a href=&#34;https://basecamp.com/shapeup&#34;&gt;Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defining scope is setting boundaries. Business priorities need to be weighed against the resource limitations (number of people available to do the work and time available) in order for testing to deliver maximum value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some considerations for scope include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Specific features or key transactions to be tested&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Types of tests included (component test vs end-to-end test)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test scenarios (peak load test vs disaster recovery)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Applications included in testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with most things in the planning phase, scope is something that can change during the test when unexpected circumstances arise or when priorities change. But it&amp;rsquo;s still a good practice to define the scope at the beginning, and update it as it changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/how-to-write-a-load-test-plan01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important, however, to &lt;em&gt;prune with intention&lt;/em&gt;. By keeping our objectives in mind, we can keep our work in line with our intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;entry-criteria&#34;&gt;Entry criteria&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occasionally, you may be asked to load test an application that isn&amp;rsquo;t ready to be load tested. This happens more often than you think. While it&amp;rsquo;s true that Performance Testing is something that should be baked into all software development from the beginning, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold true for Load Testing. Load testing is only one activity that falls underneath the broader umbrella of performance testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entry criteria are conditions that you need to be fulfilled before the testing actually begins. It’s a good idea to have these conditions communicated beforehand so that everyone is clear on what needs to be set up before you can do your job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;functional-testing-does-the-application-work&#34;&gt;Functional testing: Does the application work?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing cannot realistically be carried out until at least the core functionality has been tested and high-severity defects have been fixed. Depending on the kind of load test you want to execute, you may also want to specify that UAT has been executed, as there’s no point doing an end-to-end load test with 1000 users if it doesn’t work for one user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;load-testing-environment-is-it-production-like&#34;&gt;Load Testing Environment: Is it production-like?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonfunctional testing has stricter requirements for an environment than does functional testing, and you may have to champion this cause. For load testing, it is not enough to have an application staging environment that is a virtual machine that is a quarter of the size of the production environment. It’s important to get as close to a production-like environment as possible in terms of capacity (memory, CPU), codebase (the actual build that will be deployed), and integrations with other environments or servers (if within test scope).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing is not linear: a response time of 5 seconds on a server with half the capacity of the production server does not necessarily equate to a response time of 2.5 seconds in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the time to think about your load injectors. Will they be on-premises, or in the cloud? A good entry criterion is the availability of the machines in the right network and with the right tools installed. If you’re using commercial tools, license provisioning should be a criterion. What sort of capacity will your load testing scripts require?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;support-are-there-people-available-with-expertise-in-key-components&#34;&gt;Support: Are there people available with expertise in key components?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing is a team activity. When a load test involves multiple application teams, it’s important to request availability of key persons on those teams during the test. Often as load testers, we are seen as working independently, but the truth couldn’t be farther from that. Load testing is a team sport. We need support from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;business analysts who will be able to tell us how things are expected to work and what the current priorities are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;developers whom we can consult when poorly performing code needs to be optimised&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;functional testers who can show us how the application works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DevOps engineers who can help us provision and monitor servers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and many more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have as close a copy of the production environment as possible, keep in mind that it’s still a clean copy, which may not be realistic. If there are databases in production, how much data do they contain? The application server may respond differently when your test database is empty compared to when it must contend with gigabytes of data in the production database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using production data for testing purposes can be dangerous, not to mention illegal, in certain circumstances. To avoid this, you can scrub sensitive data or generate your own, either by injecting records into a database or by writing an automation script to create data on the front-end. If you write a script, you may be able to reuse parts of it later for your load test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;workload-modeling&#34;&gt;Workload Modeling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A workload model is a schema describing the load profile for a given test scenario, and it involves determining what (the key transactions), how much (the load distribution among the transactions) and when (timing of the load) to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workload modeling can be the most difficult part of the testing process because it involves finding out how load test scripting can best mimic what is actually happening in production. It can also be the most critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my account of working on a project in horse racing, where workload modeling was of particular importance: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/workload-modeling-preparing-for-large-events-like-the-melbourne-cup&#34;&gt;Workload Modeling - Preparing for Large Events like the Melbourne Cup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/how-to-write-a-load-test-plan03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re selling bets for the Melbourne Cup, every second matters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;server-monitoring&#34;&gt;Server monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executing a load test without monitoring server health is like flying blind. You’ll know when you land safely and you’ll know when you crash, but even if you do crash, you won’t know why—or how you can avoid it next time. Monitoring server health is the black box that will tell you what went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For load testing, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to monitor the application servers that you&amp;rsquo;re testing as well as the load generators that you&amp;rsquo;re using to run the load tests themselves. That&amp;rsquo;s right; if you&amp;rsquo;re not watching carefully, the machines you run the load tests on can be the bottlenecks in themselves, causing unnecessary failures in your load tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://testguild.com/performance-test-resource-utilization/&#34;&gt;Joe Colantonio&lt;/a&gt; goes over the basics of resource utilization in terms of four main areas of concern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPU&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/load-testing-tutorial-server-monitoring&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s another guide&lt;/a&gt; I put together on the basic metrics as well as some tools you can use to set up your monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of which metrics you identify as key or which tools you use, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to make sure that they&amp;rsquo;re all set up to measure server health before you run your load tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;test-doubles&#34;&gt;Test doubles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the strategic planning around load testing is deciding which components need to be tested in conjunction with your stated requirements. Applications can sometimes be complex enough that load testing end-to-end is not feasible due to the number of teams involved or the cost of duplicating application infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping it as simple as possible will lead to fewer dependencies, so it&amp;rsquo;s worth considering creating test doubles to isolate relevant components. Test doubles include stubs, mocks, and full virtual services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/how-to-write-a-load-test-plan04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A test double is that part that replaces a complicated component that is not within scope. It’s a “dumber” version that responds to requests enough to allow you to go on with your load testing without actually requiring that component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test doubles allow us to abstract out other components we don&amp;rsquo;t want to test so that we can concentrate on the one that we do. The point of a test double is to remove the variables and noise introduced by other parts of the application so that we can focus on testing how one component responds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are willing to put the time into creating a test double, you can drastically reduce the amount of resources you need to set up an environment and isolate components. Reducing variables in your test allows you to more quickly determine where performance bottlenecks lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;test-scenarios&#34;&gt;Test Scenarios&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A test scenario is the description of a contained situation or condition under which the application will be tested. A test scenario is usually based on several test cases and includes a plan for how these test cases will be executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing your test scenarios means deciding which situation is most likely to yield the data that you require. Employing several different types of scenarios will give you a greater understanding of your application’s capabilities. You should feel free to create your own scenarios that are uniquely tailored to your requirements, but here are some common scenarios to start out with. Take the number of users and durations mentioned as guidelines and not rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what our Flooder amigo, Señor Performo, has to say about test scenarios:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating a test plan can seem daunting, but the process of writing it serves as a prompt for discussions among your team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/how-go-performance-tester-performance-engineer&#34;&gt;pro tip from Scott Moore&lt;/a&gt;: Once you come up with a template you&amp;rsquo;re happy with, save it and reuse it for future projects. Modify it over time based on feedback to see progressive improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a set of reusable documents and other deliverables (&amp;ldquo;templates&amp;rdquo;) to use in the initial planning phase and final reporting will speed your initial startup time. I recommend working with or learning from others with experience to build out some of these templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍When in doubt, remember that the format of a test plan is not as important as making sure it is meaningful and comprehensible for your team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/pros-and-cons-of-api-load-testing&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/pros-and-cons-of-api-load-testing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍API load testing is one of the most popular ways to run a load test because of the number of open source and commercial load testing tools available on the market that support it. Creating a script to hit your application&amp;rsquo;s API endpoints is the traditional approach to load testing, but it&amp;rsquo;s not the only one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some things to consider when deciding whether or not API load testing is right for your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disadvantages-of-api-load-testing&#34;&gt;Disadvantages of API load testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;api-load-testing-does-not-simulate-real-users-interacting-with-elements-of-your-webpage&#34;&gt;API load testing does not simulate real users interacting with elements of your webpage.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‌In contrast to a customer opening up a browser and filling out forms on your site, an API load testing script will consist only of the underlying requests to the server that are made by clicking on those on-screen elements. Exactly how the customer triggers those requests, and what buttons they’ve pressed, is irrelevant. It’s all about the raw requests.‌&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The format of these requests will be dictated by the type of API your application uses, and it may take some technical knowledge or expertise to be able to formulate requests correctly. However, a RESTful API is one of the most common types, and it is considered to be relatively simple to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200818-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;HTTPS requests for amazon.com. This is what an API load testing script would need to replicate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-doesnt-give-you-an-idea-of-how-user-friendly-your-application-is&#34;&gt;It doesn’t give you an idea of how user-friendly your application is.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‌API load testing tools don’t give you feedback on how long your pictures took to render on your users’ browsers or whether that “SUBMIT” button is in an obvious spot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-doesnt-measure-front-end-performance-or-how-quickly-pages-render-in-different-browsers&#34;&gt;‌It doesn’t measure front-end performance or how quickly pages render in different browsers.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‌While all the resources that the server returns can be downloaded by your tool of choice, there is no browser on which to run them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;api-load-testing-doesnt-run-client-side-scripts&#34;&gt;‌API load testing doesn’t run client-side scripts.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‌It isn’t what you’re looking for if your application is a single-page web app that relies heavily on JavaScript or AJAX to dynamically populate and update the page. Your load testing tool will download the scripts, but not execute them.‌&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‌This includes scripts like those required to trigger Google Analytics, which prompts many an engineer to question the results of an API load test due to the inability to see the traffic come in on Google Analytics. API load testing won’t help you with that. Running browser-level load tests using tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://element.flood.io&#34;&gt;Flood Element&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://selenium.dev&#34;&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt; may be more useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve decided that API load testing is not the best way to load test your application, you can look at browser-based load testing as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200818-02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Executing a browser-based load testing script using Flood Element.&lt;/em&gt;
‌&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;advantages-of-api-load-testing&#34;&gt;‌Advantages of API load testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve talked about what API load testing isn’t good at, let’s talk about what it IS good at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‌### It allows you to load test specific servers rather than the whole stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‌API load testing allows you to tailor your load testing by applying load only on particular servers. This is particularly useful in more complicated applications that involve several components and would require substantial effort to reproduce in a test environment. Using APIs, you can test only the functions you want to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-is-well-supported-&#34;&gt;It is well-supported. ‌&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;API load testing has been around for decades. There are lots of robust tools you can choose from, both commercial and open-source, and many of these tools have large communities and extensive documentation around how to script the most common cases. It’s a far cry from the browser-level testing space, which is relatively new and sparsely populated by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200818-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/index.html&#34;&gt;JMeter site&lt;/a&gt; contains a wealth of information, including a User&amp;rsquo;s Manual&lt;/em&gt;
‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;its-not-as-resource-intensive-as-browser-level-testing&#34;&gt;It’s not as resource-intensive as browser-level testing.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can simulate more users with API load testing than with browser-level load testing. Since most interactions on the browser-level get translated to requests anyway, generating load this way is incredibly efficient, allowing you to hit your server with requests while bypassing the UI layer and the resource overhead that that entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, at &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io&#34;&gt;Flood&lt;/a&gt; we’ve baselined some of the tools that we support to see how many users we can run on an AWS m5.xlarge instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selenium: 5 users
Flood Element: 20-40 users
JMeter: 1000 users
Gatling: 1000 users&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‌You’ll see that the browser-level test tools, Selenium and Flood Element, can run significantly fewer users on the same sized node as can the protocol-level tools, JMeter and Gatling. This isn’t due to an inefficiency in the tools but rather to the fact that browser-level tools inherently need more CPU and memory to start separate instances of browsers per user and render pages graphically. You can run more users per node (or machine) by carrying out API load testing with protocol-level tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;its-cheaper&#34;&gt;It’s cheaper.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‌The efficiency in resource utilization translates directly into cost savings because every node that you don’t need to execute your tests on is one fewer node that you’ll have to pay to provision (whether on premises or in the cloud).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‌For this reason, API load testing is one of the most cost-efficient ways you can get started with load testing, allowing you to scale up your load relatively cheaply while getting immediate results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-get-started-with-api-load-testing&#34;&gt;How to get started with API load testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;API load testing isn&amp;rsquo;t for every application, but depending on your test scenario, it may be the easiest way to test application performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re new to non-functional testing or API load testing in particular and would like some step-by-step tutorials on how to get started, check out my free ebook, &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/ebooks/api-load-testing&#34;&gt;API Load Testing: A Beginner&amp;rsquo;s Guide&lt;/a&gt;. It takes you through the basics of API load testing, including planning your first load test, selecting an open source tool, scripting, executing a test on the cloud, analyzing results, and even integrating it into your CI/CD pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/performance-testing-the-story-of-the-dutch-coronavirus-hotline&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read the original Dutch version &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20200704-performanceverbeteringen-voor-de-coronalijn/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This English version was first posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/performance-testing-the-story-of-the-dutch-coronavirus-hotline&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On June 1st, 2020, the National Institute of Health and Environment (RIVM) announced that everyone with certain symptoms could call the hotline 0800-1202 to arrange a free COVID-19 test. The promise: call today, get tested tomorrow, and receive the results the day after that. The reality, though, did not live up to expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opening day of the hotline was chaotic, and many Dutch people reported connection problems due to a system overload. Yet this could have been prevented with a better understanding of how human psychology can affect application performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-situation&#34;&gt;The situation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nos.nl/collectie/13824/artikel/2335758-ggd-en-klaar-voor-massaal-testen-tijd-van-limiterende-factoren-voorbij&#34;&gt;According to Dr. Ann Vossen&lt;/a&gt;, chairperson of the task force charged with scaling up mass testing in the Netherlands, the country was ready to process 30,000 tests per day. This number corresponds to &lt;a href=&#34;https://nos.nl/artikel/2335790-drukte-op-nieuw-telefoonnummer-voor-coronatests-0800-1202.html&#34;&gt;the national capacity&lt;/a&gt; of all the municipal health clinics (GGDs) in the Netherlands. Despite this claim, though, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/liefst-323-000-telefoontjes-naar-nieuw-nummer-voor-coronatest-systemen-overbelast~a16a9a50&#34;&gt;only 1,146 people were actually tested&lt;/a&gt; on the first day of testing (the day after the opening of the hotline). Perhaps more importantly, only 5,748 appointments were set on June 1st. The situation was no doubt exacerbated by the overwhelming 323,000 people who called the hotline on its first day, prompting even the telephone operators to admit that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/coronatestnummer-kampt-met-kinderziektes-maar-ggd-s-kunnen-de-drukte-goed-aan~b2f332d2/&#34;&gt;they&amp;rsquo;d had troubles&lt;/a&gt; logging into the appointment system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200704-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Bron: From &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/GGDGHORNL/status/1267351996379643906&#34;&gt;@ggdghornl&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&amp;ldquo;We see that there are many calls going to 0800-1202. You can call for an appointment until 8pm tonight. Please try your call later to avoid long wait times.&amp;quot;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, users shared horror stories: one claimed to have &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Ed_van_Iterson/status/1267429180347691011&#34;&gt;waited on the line for 6 hours&lt;/a&gt;, only to be told that the system was down and no appointments could be made; another complained about &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/maticus_spazz/status/1267374692941418496&#34;&gt;getting disconnected&lt;/a&gt; after getting in touch with an operator. Yet another &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/leovanlinden/status/1267408142813605888&#34;&gt;posted a video&lt;/a&gt; of calling the hotline and a recorded message saying &amp;ldquo;Al onze medewekers zijn op dit moment in gesprek. We zullen u zo snel mogelijk te woord staan. [All of our operators are currently on other calls. We will answer you as soon as possible].&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second day was somewhat better: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/coronatestnummer-kampt-met-kinderziektes-maar-ggd-s-kunnen-de-drukte-goed-aan~b2f332d2/&#34;&gt;there were 11,000 appointments made&lt;/a&gt;, partly because of the lower amount of phone calls and partly because of some fixes of technical problems. In the first week, the number of appointments increased to 50,000 (about 7,142 per day), which was still significantly lower than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some lessons that we can learn from this case study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;English translation:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have these (mild) symptoms?:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;cough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;blocked or runny nose&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Make an appointment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call the national number 0800-1202&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have your BSN with you when you call&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make an appointment to get tested at one of our locations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2: Test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to the selected location at the scheduled time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will be tested at the test location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3: Results and eventual start of source and contact research&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will be called with your results within 48 hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are infected with the coronavirus, the GGD will call you for source and contact research
*If you show more serious symptoms, or if you fall within a high-risk group, report to your doctor or to the emergency help line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-effect-of-fear-on-performance&#34;&gt;The effect of fear on performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This coronavirus has already shown us a side of humanity that we&amp;rsquo;d perhaps rather not see: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-51731422&#34;&gt;fights over toilet paper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://snacks.robinhood.com/newsletters/rMxwcb7y7lMZoI5NY6qf7/&#34;&gt;chaos on the stock market&lt;/a&gt; due to panic, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/nctv-waarschuwt-voor-extremistische-protestacties-door-5g-tegenstanders-die-vrezen-voor-coronavirus~bf1400b8/&#34;&gt;sabotage of 5G cell towers&lt;/a&gt; based on a belief that they caused COVID-19. As much as we&amp;rsquo;d like to believe it, we&amp;rsquo;re not always the most rational beings. We all have the tendency to behave unpredictably, especially when we&amp;rsquo;re afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no wonder that the coronavirus testing line was so welcome. The fact that there were 323,000 callers on the first day is even more remarkable when we remember that majority of Dutch residents had been in self-isolation for months at that point, which lowered their chances of contracting the virus. In theory, the fear that drove these callers might have been somewhat irrational, but not unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200704-03.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In English, we call this FOMO (Fear of Missing Out). We&amp;rsquo;ve already clearly seen &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/fomo-and-performance-testing-why-robinhood-went-down&#34;&gt;how FOMO can drive users&lt;/a&gt; en masse to an application, with effects on its performance. In this case, people were afraid that coronavirus test shortages would mean there weren&amp;rsquo;t enough tests to go around, and they wanted to be first in line to get tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another problem was that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.trouw.nl/binnenland/de-balans-na-een-week-testen-het-plan-was-mooier-dan-de-praktijk~b86399b7/&#34;&gt;one in four callers&lt;/a&gt; just wanted general information about COVID-19, despite government pleas to keep the hotline free for coronavirus test appointments only. It didn&amp;rsquo;t help that the hotline opened on a Dutch national holiday, White Monday, and more people were home than usual for a Monday. The high number of unrelated calls was unexpected, but nevertheless factored into system overload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What could we have done to improve this system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;improvements-to-the-corona-hotline&#34;&gt;Improvements to the corona hotline&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;better-estimation&#34;&gt;Better estimation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As difficult as it is to predict FOMO&amp;rsquo;s effects, we can still try. We can make educated guesses based on related statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just one month before the coronavirus test hotline was opened, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zwollenu.nl/500-000-tot-700-000-nederlanders-besmet-met-coronavirus/&#34;&gt;Jaap van Dissel&lt;/a&gt;, the head of RIVM, estimated that there were up to 700,000 Dutch residents infected by the coronavirus. Why, then, was it such a surprise that more than 300,000 of them had called? Furthermore, the RIVM had encouraged people with a broad list of symptoms (such as colds, coughs, or fever) to call, and it&amp;rsquo;s reasonable to assume that some people with conditions other than COVID-19 might also have called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if we assume that 20% of the 700,000 people with the novel coronavirus did not have symptoms (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200306-sitrep-46-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=96b04adf_4&#34;&gt;according to WHO research&lt;/a&gt;), we still arrive at a predicted 140,000 calls, which is still 25 times what was the coronavirus testing system was able to process on the first day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have an educated estimate, we can start testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200704-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;injecting-load&#34;&gt;Injecting load&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a resident calls the hotline, the call is routed to one of several operators working from home. This is often done with a telephony server that forwards calls based on some type of round-robin system. We can execute load tests on this server to determine how many phone calls a server can process and route successfully, with minimal delay and without message queueing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, the operator enters personal information from the caller into the appointment system, including their government identification number (BSN) and address. We can surmise that the system checks the identity to verify the validity of the BSN, and then sends some details to a database. The closest municipal clinic to the caller can then use the data to process and schedule an appointment. We can also inject load at this stage by simulating the calls that the appointment system creates with an API load testing tool like JMeter or Gatling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-different-test-scenarios&#34;&gt;Using different test scenarios&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With such a public announcement of the hotline&amp;rsquo;s opening, a &lt;strong&gt;spike test&lt;/strong&gt; before release could have yielded some useful information. In a spike test, we simulate a sharp increase in users over a short period of time. For example, we could have simulated an increase in users from 0 to 700,000 on the telephony system over 10 minutes to see how the application would have handled that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soak tests&lt;/strong&gt; could also have been useful in this case. The hotline&amp;rsquo;s opening hours were from 8 am to 8 pm, so it was open for 12 hours in total. With soak tests, we can generate load on an application for an extended amount of time. Soak tests can reveal memory leaks or other bottlenecks in the processing of data that might occur after hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are ways we could have tested the system as it is, but are there improvements that we could have made in the system to make it more resilient to reduce the FOMO factor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-automation-to-lessen-fomo-risk&#34;&gt;Using automation to lessen FOMO risk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system had some manual parts of the process that may have exacerbated load issues. Here&amp;rsquo;s how this system could have been automated to reduce bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;interactive-voice-response&#34;&gt;Interactive Voice Response&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telephony servers commonly use Interactive Voice Response (IVR), an automated menu system for voice calls that uses either voice recognition or keypress tones to navigate a user through a series of choices. We&amp;rsquo;re all familiar with it: &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;For Dutch, press 1. For English, press 2&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo; Such a system might have helped reduce the overall load by quickly filtering out callers in the 25% who weren&amp;rsquo;t interested in creating an appointment. &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d like to book an appointment for a coronavirus test, press 1. Otherwise, please call the information hotline at&amp;hellip;.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s what an IVR system could look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200704-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;From: &lt;a href=&#34;http://vanguardnetworks.com.sg/IVR.html&#34;&gt;Vanguard Networks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
‍
Load testing IVR systems can be difficult, and it usually requires the use of highly specialized commercial tools. However, introducing a new tool may also increase the time required for load testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;building-a-web-app&#34;&gt;Building a web app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another approach would be to implement a web app to verify identity and capture personal information quickly. In the Netherlands, we already have &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.digid.nl/wat-is-digid/&#34;&gt;DigiD&lt;/a&gt;, an identity verification system that is heavily used for governmental services. &lt;a href=&#34;https://mijn.overheid.nl/&#34;&gt;Mijn Overheid&lt;/a&gt;, which is a central government portal accessible to every Dutch resident, already interfaces with DigiD as the sole method of logging in. Reusing these existing services could have saved a lot of the work on a web app— not to mention reducing the bottlenecks inherent in a more manual process like a telephone hotline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200704-06.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mijn.overheid.nl/&#34;&gt;Mijn Overheid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;testing-the-system-end-to-end&#34;&gt;Testing the system end-to-end&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve identified a few ways to load test various components of the coronavirus hotline, both in its current incarnation as well as in hypothetical improved versions. Isolating each component and running load tests at that level can help us resolve performance issues inherent in the component. However, there are still bottlenecks that are only revealed when the integrations between components is tested as well. That&amp;rsquo;s where end-to-end testing comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the coronavirus hotline, end-to-end testing means being able to run load tests on the entire process and seeing how data flows from one to the other: the call forwarding from the telephony server, the identity verification system, the appointment system, the database of personal information, the servers of every municipal clinic, and the email/text notifications with appointment details. As modern applications grow more complex, it can be tempting not to run end-to-end tests, but we do so at great risk of functional or nonfunctional issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An area of end-to-end testing that is often overlooked is the human factor, which can also be a bottleneck. Had hotline operators been trained to ask early on in the call whether the caller wanted to make an appointment, to filter out unrelated calls? Can the coronavirus testing and test result processing, heavily involving manual work from medical professionals, match the stated requirements (test within 24 hours, result within 48 hours) even when the digital components are performant? Some people waited for an hour in the cities of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ed.nl/eindhoven/in-de-file-voor-een-stukje-zekerheid-meteen-drukte-bij-teststraat-voor-corona-in-eindhoven~a27eec83/&#34;&gt;Eindhoven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pzc.nl/zeeuws-nieuws/drukte-bij-teststraat-in-goes-na-openstellen-nummer-voor-coronatest~aa8a6cb2/&#34;&gt;Goes&lt;/a&gt; due to traffic congestion from cars near the test centers, leading to delays in the testing schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it can be difficult to load test these logistical systems with automated tools, they may have significant effects on the overall performance of an application and should be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, performance issues can lead to a tangible loss in profits or a more intangible loss in reputation. In this case study, poor performance had a direct impact on people&amp;rsquo;s health. Potentially sick people were unable to make appointments to get tested, and later treated. Delayed tests could have led to an increased infection rate as people waited for a confirmed diagnosis. Hotline operators also admitted that slowness in the system led to them sometimes &lt;a href=&#34;https://wnl.tv/2020/06/08/chaos-bij-de-coronalijn-personeel-slaat-alarm/&#34;&gt;giving out test results&lt;/a&gt; against instructions to wait for trained medical professionals to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200704-07.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human psychological factors can make a system more complex to load test. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.trouw.nl/binnenland/de-balans-na-een-week-testen-het-plan-was-mooier-dan-de-praktijk~b86399b7/&#34;&gt;According to Andrea Evers&lt;/a&gt; (LUCM), a health psychological professor, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Door de uitbraak van corona zijn mensen in een langdurige stresssituatie beland. Onzekerheid, onvoorspelbaarheid en oncontroleerbaarheid maken dat ze de behoefte hebben om zaken juist wel te controleren of voorspelbaar te maken&lt;/em&gt; [The coronavirus outbreak has put people in a situation of chronic stress. The uncertainty, unpredictability, and helplessness of the situation cause a need to make things controllable or predictable].&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As performance testers, we can use statistics and a systematic attitude combined with knowledge of human factors in applications to try to predict the unpredictable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-20-how-can-fear-affect-application-performance-video&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about the power of fear, and how it can end up affecting performance test results.

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or listen to the audio version here:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/2cOfQrrUwyIKWbztgNdoXR&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;232&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, I&amp;rsquo;m Nicole van der Hoeven, back with another Ask a Flooder, and today I want to talk about the effect of fear on your performance outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-dutch-coronalijn&#34;&gt;The Dutch &amp;ldquo;coronalijn&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently live in Maastricht, in the Netherlands. At the beginning of this global pandemic, the only people getting tested actively for COVID-19 were either people who presented with serious symptoms of the disease, or health care professionals who were continually exposed to the disease and therefore at a higher risk of contracting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, on June 1st, the Dutch government made testing available to everybody. They set up a telephone hotline that any Dutch resident could call to set an appointment to get tested for a COVID-19 test. A task force was dispatched to make sure that they could test up to 30.000 people per day. Yet on the first day of testing, only 1.146 people were tested. So what happened?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it turned out that the bottleneck of the entire process wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting enough tests, registering the tests, or even processing the test results. The bottleneck actually occurred way before that, when people called up the hotline to get an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;323.000 people called on the first day that the hotline opened. And not even all of them had called to make an appointment. Some of them were just calling for general information on the coronavirus despite the fact that the government made it clear that that&amp;rsquo;s not what the line was for, and that there were other lines dedicated to information. There were reports on Twitter of people waiting up to 6 hours on the line just to talk to someone who would make an appointment for them. There were calls that got dropped. People said that sometimes it happened in the middle of a call. Even telephone operators that   the appointment system was down or slow and unusable for a lot of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, only 5,500 people actually had appointments booked on a day where there were 323,000 that called. That&amp;rsquo;s 1.70%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-that-have-to-do-with-performance&#34;&gt;What does that have to do with performance?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As performance engineers, we like to believe that everything we do is reasoned. We design tests based on quantitative data. We look at historical trends and metrics to help us decide how to build a workload model. But the truth is that that&amp;rsquo;s often not enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything, this pandemic has shown us just how wrong our guesses can be, whether or not they&amp;rsquo;re  informed by facts, especially when it has to do with human behavior. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen violent fights erupt over toilet paper. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen peaks and troughs on the stock market that didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything to do with the underlying companies. We&amp;rsquo;ve seen arson on 5G cell towers. Because human beings are irrational, and it&amp;rsquo;s really hard to capture that irrationality in our model for how users are going to behave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may never be able to accurate predict how irrationality is going to affect the load on our application in production. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t try. There are still things that we can do to mitigate the risk. I think that any application that is public-facing should be assessed for exposure to the risk of fear or other human psychological factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-we-account-for-fear-in-our-performance-testing&#34;&gt;How do we account for fear in our performance testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually wrote a whole blog post on this particular situation (the Dutch corona line), and how it might have been possible to predict (maybe not with 100% accuracy but with reasonable accuracy) how many people would have called the hotline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, we can look at statistics like the of the Netherlands or how many people normally get flu-like symptoms or at least report them at this time of the year. These are statistics that are readily available from the Department of Health, and we could have used them to inform our decisions on the workload model for such an application. We may not have gotten it exactly, but we would have at least bin in the same ballpark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have a good enough idea about the workload that our application would have to handle when it&amp;rsquo;s influenced by fear, we can start running load tests around that. Another good open-ended kind of test to run, especially for applications that are particularly susceptible to fear, is the stress test. In a stress test, you push your application to its limits and you find out what they are. You could, for instance, start with your peak work load, and then add a certain number of users every 30 minutes and see how much your application can actually handle. You can do the same with soak tests, where you&amp;rsquo;re exposing your application to the same amount of load for an extended period of time. Both of those kind of exploratory tests help you define the limits of your application and how it would respond if fear plays a role in the workload model in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we overlook this critical human element in our test design, then we leave ourselves, and our applications, vulnerable to performance degradation and, perhaps, outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Read &lt;a href=&#34;blog/20200813-dutch-coronavirus-hotline/&#34;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; for more about the coronavirus hotline.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-18-how-do-i-load-test-video-streaming-with-jmeter-video&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, I answer the question: &amp;ldquo;How do I load test video streaming with JMeter?&amp;rdquo;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q00briuogto&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or listen to the audio version here:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/69F5lmOeFfEJr6ZgVWFGOu&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;232&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;http-live-streaming-hls-and-performance&#34;&gt;HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most popular protocols for video streaming is &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/streaming/examples/&#34;&gt;HTTP Live Streaming&lt;/a&gt;, or HLS, and that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you today. An HLS video ends with the [file extension .m3u8‍](&lt;a href=&#34;https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/streaming/examples/bipbop_4x3/bipbop_4x3_variant.m3u8%5D(https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/streaming/examples/bipbop_4x3/bipbop_4x3_variant.m3u8)&#34;&gt;https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/streaming/examples/bipbop_4x3/bipbop_4x3_variant.m3u8](https://devstreaming-cdn.apple.com/videos/streaming/examples/bipbop_4x3/bipbop_4x3_variant.m3u8)&lt;/a&gt;. According to the HLS protocol, when a video is streamed, the first request sent must be a manifest. A manifest is sometimes called a playlist, and it is a list of all the chunks or parts that make up the video. Then, each chunk is downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the performance of a video stream, we still want the response time of the manifest, the chunks, and the whole video. However, there are many more metrics that are important in video streaming which aren&amp;rsquo;t captured by just the response time. For example, how do you determine whether a video was played smoothly or if it stopped to buffer? A video that keeps pausing might just drive a user away, and it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to tell whether that is happening just from the response time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-load-test-video-streaming-with-jmeter&#34;&gt;How to load test video streaming with JMeter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;downloading-and-installing-the-ubik-video-streaming-plugin&#34;&gt;Downloading and installing the Ubik Video Streaming plugin&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there&amp;rsquo;s a plugin for that, created by a company called Ubik Ingénierie. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://ubikloadpack.com/&#34;&gt;Ubik Load Pack&lt;/a&gt; is a set of enterprise-grade plugins for JMeter. One of those plugins is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://ubikloadpack.com/video-streaming-performance.php&#34;&gt;Video Streaming Plugin&lt;/a&gt;, and it happens to be a really easy way to get started with video streaming. This is a paid plugin, but you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://ubikloadpack.com/video-streaming-performance.php#formulaire&#34;&gt;sign up for a free 11-day trial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you do that, you&amp;rsquo;ll get an email from Ubik with a link to download the bundle. Go to lib/ext and then copy this .jar file into the same directory on your JMeter installation. Start up JMeter, and it&amp;rsquo;ll ask you for the license file. Browse to the license file in the bundle you downloaded. JMeter will restart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-the-jmeter-plugin-in-your-load-testing-script&#34;&gt;Using the JMeter plugin in your load testing script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s start creating the Test Plan. Create a Thread group, and then right click on the thread group, go to Add &amp;gt; Sampler and then select the &amp;ldquo;ULP Video Streaming sampler&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the sampler and then paste in the URL to the HLS file that you&amp;rsquo;d like to test. This should end in a .m3u8. This plugin supports several protocols for video streaming, but we can just leave it at auto and it&amp;rsquo;ll automatically detect which one it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Play Options, you can choose whether to play the entire video or just a part of it, or even whether you want to include the video subtitles in your test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Network Options panel is fantastic because it allows you to limit your network speed. Slow networks, like mobile networks, really affect user experience, so it&amp;rsquo;s really important to take this into account when running load tests. You might even use a parameter here and do something like throttle to 3G speeds for 80% of your traffic, and leave it on Auto 20% of the time. But I&amp;rsquo;ll just leave this blank for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, let&amp;rsquo;s add a View Results Tree listener. Then, let&amp;rsquo;s run the script once, just to see if it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we can see the manifest retrieved first, and then all the chunks. We didn&amp;rsquo;t get any errors, so let&amp;rsquo;s run this as a load test. We can disable this listener because it just consumes extra resources on our load generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ramping-up-your-load-test-on-flood&#34;&gt;Ramping up your load test on Flood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ramp this up into a load test, we&amp;rsquo;ll have to go into Thread Group and change these settings. Ideally, we want to be able to change these values from the Flood UI later so we don&amp;rsquo;t have to go into the script whenever we change them, so I&amp;rsquo;ll type in these Flood-specific properties. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave a link in the description about these properties. I&amp;rsquo;ll also set it to run Forever so that we can change the duration and the video will just keep playing to fill that duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To capture some of Ubik&amp;rsquo;s cool metrics, let&amp;rsquo;s add a Simple Data Writer listener here and write the results to a CSV file. On Flood, all flood results are stored on /data/flood/results, so we&amp;rsquo;ll add an output.csv file in that directory that we can download after the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s our script! Now we&amp;rsquo;ll have to include the plugin and related files so that Flood can access them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go back to the bundle we downloaded and go to the bin folder to look for &lt;a href=&#34;http://user.properties/&#34;&gt;user.properties&lt;/a&gt;. Let&amp;rsquo;s open that up, and we&amp;rsquo;ll change the license path to &lt;code&gt;/data/flood/files&lt;/code&gt;, which is the directory that Flood saves files we upload to. To preserve this directory structure, we&amp;rsquo;ll compress just the lib and bin folders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Flood, we&amp;rsquo;ll start a new stream here and upload three things: the jmx script, the license, and the compressed archive of the lib and bin folders from the bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then we&amp;rsquo;ll go through the rest of the process here, setting the test parameters. Time to launch the test!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analyzing-video-streaming-load-test-results&#34;&gt;Analyzing video streaming load test results&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flood shows you results of your load test while it&amp;rsquo;s running as well as after the test. You can see metrics like concurrency, network throughput, transaction rate, and response time for the test. You can also see these metrics for each individual transaction, including the video or sampler as a whole, the manifest, and the chunks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see the CSV that our script generated, we can download the Archived Results from a flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In JMeter, click on Tools &amp;gt; Generate Report and fill in the fields, selecting the output.csv from the flood&amp;rsquo;s Archived Results, JMeter&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://user.properties&#34;&gt;user.properties&lt;/a&gt; file, and then an output directory for the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubik&amp;rsquo;s plugin creates a few custom graphs in the HTML report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buffer fill in Millis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lag ratio in percentage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lag ratio without buffer fill in percentage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lag time in Millis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using Ubik&amp;rsquo;s Video Streaming plugin is an easy and thorough way to load test video streaming with JMeter, and I highly recommend it. I used an HLS video to demonstrate it, but this plugin supports several protocols:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;HLS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mpeg DASH&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Smooth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adobe HDS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information, read Ubik&amp;rsquo;s tutorial on how to use their plugin with Flood &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/running-a-video-streaming-performance-test-using-flood-io-and-ubikloadpack&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published on &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@n_vanderhoeven/performanceverbeteringen-voor-de-coronalijn-de-kracht-van-angst-8c3713a3b7e0&#34;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt;. English version &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/performance-testing-the-story-of-the-dutch-co2020ronavirus-hotline&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Op 1 juni heeft de landelijke GGD Ghor aangekondigd dat iedereen met klachten een coronatest zou kunnen aanvragen door de afsprakenlijn (0800–1202) te bellen. De belofte: vandaag het telefoongesprek, morgen de coronatest en over twee dagen de uitslag. Echter was het in werkelijkheid niet zo makkelijk. Op de eerste dag was er chaos en veel Nederlanders meldden verbindingsproblemen vanwege drukte op de overbelaste systemen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dit had voorkomen kunnen worden door een beter begrip te hebben over de manier waarop de menselijke psychologie de performance van een systeem kan beïnvloeden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200704-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Bron: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/GGDGHORNL/status/1267351996379643906&#34;&gt;@ggdghornl&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;de-situatie&#34;&gt;De situatie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Voor die 30.000 tests per dag zijn we nu eindelijk klaar”, &lt;a href=&#34;https://nos.nl/collectie/13824/artikel/2335758-ggd-en-klaar-voor-massaal-testen-tijd-van-limiterende-factoren-voorbij&#34;&gt;zei arts Ann Vossen&lt;/a&gt; op 31 mei. Dit aantal verwijst naar de &lt;a href=&#34;https://nos.nl/artikel/2335790-drukte-op-nieuw-telefoonnummer-voor-coronatests-0800-1202.html&#34;&gt;landelijke capaciteit&lt;/a&gt; van alle GGD’s. In plaats daarvan werden volgens het AD maar 1146 mensen getest en, misschien belangrijker, een kleine 5478 afspraken gemaakt. De situatie werd erger gemaakt door de &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ad.nl/binnenland/liefst-323-000-telefoontjes-naar-nieuw-nummer-voor-coronatest-systemen-overbelast~a16a9a50/&#34;&gt;323.000 mensen&lt;/a&gt; die de afspraaklijn op de eerste dag hebben gebeld. Sommige medewerkers konden zelfs &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/coronatestnummer-kampt-met-kinderziektes-maar-ggd-s-kunnen-de-drukte-goed-aan~b2f332d2/&#34;&gt;niet in de systemen inloggen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Op Twitter vertelden gebruikers enkele horrorverhalen: één beweerde &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Ed_van_Iterson/status/1267429180347691011&#34;&gt;6 uur lang te hebben gewacht&lt;/a&gt;, alleen om een melding te horen dat het systeem geen afspraken kon aanmaken; een andere klaagde over &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/maticus_spazz/status/1267374692941418496&#34;&gt;verbroken verbindingen&lt;/a&gt;, zelfs toen een medewerker al had geantwoord, en nog een andere &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/leovanlinden/status/1267408142813605888&#34;&gt;een video had gepost&lt;/a&gt; van een gesprek dat beëindigd was zonder melding. Ik heb zelf ook de &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/n_vanderhoeven/status/1271054286483533825&#34;&gt;coronalijn gebeld&lt;/a&gt;, en nieuwe problemen gevonden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gelukkig was de tweede dag beter: er waren 11 duizend afspraken gemaakt, mede vanwege het lagere aantal telefoontjes en mede vanwege verholpen technische problemen. In de eerste week nam het aantal geteste mensen toe naar 50.000 (gemiddeld 7142 per dag), wat toch nog veel lager zat dan verwacht. Er zijn wat lessen die we kunnen trekken uit dit verhaal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;het-gevolgen-van-angst-op-performance&#34;&gt;Het gevolgen van angst op performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dit virus heeft ons al een kant van de mensheid getoond die we liever niet willen zien: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-51731422&#34;&gt;vechten over wc-papier&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://snacks.robinhood.com/newsletters/rMxwcb7y7lMZoI5NY6qf7/&#34;&gt;chaos op de beurs&lt;/a&gt;, en &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/nctv-waarschuwt-voor-extremistische-protestacties-door-5g-tegenstanders-die-vrezen-voor-coronavirus~bf1400b8/&#34;&gt;sabotage van zendmasten&lt;/a&gt;. Hoewel we rationeel willen zijn, is het onmogelijk te zeggen dat dat altijd het geval is. In werkelijkheid hebben we allemaal de neiging gekke dingen te doen. Vooral als we angst hebben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geen wonder dan dat de afspraaklijn zo welkom was. 323.000 telefoontjes werden er op de eerste dag verwerkt, wat bijzonder is als we bedenken dat het grootste deel van Nederland in zelfisolatie was, en dus maar een kleine kans had om het coronavirus opgelopen te hebben. In theorie lijkt dit gedrag irrationeel, maar niet onvoorspelbaar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200704-03.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In het Engels heet het &lt;strong&gt;FOMO&lt;/strong&gt;: Fear Of Missing Out. We hebben al &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/fomo-and-performance-testing-why-robinhood-went-down&#34;&gt;duidelijk gezien&lt;/a&gt; hoe FOMO veel meer gebruikers naar een applicatie kan dwingen, met als gevolg bijwerkingen op de performance. Mensen hadden angst dat er niet genoeg coronatesten waren en wilden de eersten in de rij zijn voordat de voorraad helemaal op was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ook was er het probleem dat &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.trouw.nl/binnenland/de-balans-na-een-week-testen-het-plan-was-mooier-dan-de-praktijk~b86399b7/&#34;&gt;één op de vier telefoontjes niet over een afspraak ging&lt;/a&gt;, maar over algemene informatie over COVID-19. Dit werd verergerd door het feit dat de eerste dag van de coronalijn ook Tweede Pinksterdag was. Het teveel aan telefoontjes over andere zaken dan de coronatest was een bijkomende factor in de systeemoverbelasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wat hadden we kunnen doen om dit systeem te verbeteren?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;verbeteringen&#34;&gt;Verbeteringen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;beter-inschatten&#34;&gt;Beter inschatten&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoewel het moeilijk is om de gevolgen van FOMO precies te kennen, kunnen we het wel inschatten. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zwollenu.nl/500-000-tot-700-000-nederlanders-besmet-met-coronavirus/&#34;&gt;Volgens RIVM-hoofd Jaap van Dissel&lt;/a&gt;, waren er begin mei tot 700.000 mensen in Nederland besmet met het coronavirus, een paar weken voor de coronalijn werd opgestart. Waarom was het dan een verrassing dat meer dan 300.000 mensen hadden gebeld? Ook zijn de cijfers van niet-COVID-gerelateerde klachten daar nog niet bij inbegrepen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zelfs als we inschatten dat &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200306-sitrep-46-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=96b04adf_4&#34;&gt;20% van die 700.000 mensen geen klachten had&lt;/a&gt;, komen we toch op een voorspelling van 140.000 telefoontjes uit, wat nog &lt;strong&gt;25 keer&lt;/strong&gt; meer is dan het werkelijke aantal gemaakte afspraken op de eerste dag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zodra wij aantallen hebben, kunnen we testen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200704-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uit mijn eigen ervaring, toen ik het coronanummer belde, blijkt dat er een telefonieserver was die de oproepen heeft doorgeschakeld naar verschillende medewerkers (die thuis werkten). In deze stap konden loadtesten worden uitgevoerd om zeker te weten hoeveel gesprekken deze server aankon, en dat het snel genoeg was om geen of weinig message queueing te hebben.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medewerkers hebben dan vermoedelijk gegevens direct in een afsprakensysteem ingevoerd tijdens de oproep, waarop de gegevens waarschijnlijk naar een backend server en database gingen. Ook hier kunnen we testen via een load testing tool op protocol niveau, zoals JMeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Met zo’n publieke startdatum zou ik spike testen hebben gevoerd met tot 700.000 gebruikers (misschien nog meer, als ik wat tijd had). In een spike test simuleren we een snelle toename van gebruikers op een kort tijdstip, bijvoorbeeld 1 tot 700.000 gebruikers in 10 minuten. Ook zouden soak testen heel nuttig zijn geweest, vooral omdat de coronalijn van 08.00 tot 20.00 was geopend, dus een stroom van 12 uur. In een soak test voeren we een constante aantal gebruikers voor een langere periode op.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;automatisering-gebruiken&#34;&gt;Automatisering gebruiken&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Het maken van een afspraak voor de coronatest had veel stappen. Eerst moesten mensen hun BSN en andere details aan de medewerkers geven. Dan moesten medewerkers vragen naar hun klachten. Alleen met de &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zwollenu.nl/500-000-tot-700-000-nederlanders-besmet-met-coronavirus/&#34;&gt;belangrijkste klachten&lt;/a&gt; die passen bij het coronavirus konden mensen verdergaan. Uiteindelijk moesten medewerkers adressen controleren en het dichtstbijzijnde testcentrum vinden om de afspraak te maken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telefoniesystemen gebruiken soms Interactive Voice Response (IVR) technologie, een systeem van menu’s en keuzen. We hebben dit allemaal gebruikt: “Voor het Nederlands, toets 1. Voor het Engels, toets 2…” Zo’n systeem had het aantal niet afspraak-gerelateerde gesprekken kunnen verlagen met 25% (één op vier klanten belden niet voor een afspraak), en op een geautomatiseerde manier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hier is een voorbeeld van een IVR-systeem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200704-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Bron: &lt;a href=&#34;http://vanguardnetworks.com.sg/IVR.html&#34;&gt;Vanguard Networks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Op het niveau van het IVR-systeem kan het wel moeilijk zijn om load te simuleren. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.empirix.com/products/hammer/&#34;&gt;Empirix Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cyara.com/genesys-cloud/&#34;&gt;Cyara&lt;/a&gt; zijn twee zeer gespecialiseerde tools die dit kunnen doen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nog een optie voor de implementatie van een afsprakensysteem is een web app, met verplichte velden voor BSN, adressen, enz, en met een verbinding met DigiD, een identiteitsverificatiesysteem. &lt;a href=&#34;https://mijn.overheid.nl/&#34;&gt;Mijn Overheid&lt;/a&gt; bestaat al, en ook met DigiD integratie. Er had een soort van beveiligde formulier kunnen worden gebruikt om klantengegevens snel op te nemen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200704-06.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Bron: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mijn.overheid.nl/&#34;&gt;Mijn Overheid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;end-to-end-testing-uitvoeren&#34;&gt;End-to-end testing uitvoeren&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaak spreken we over de performance van één applicatieserver, maar in praktijk zijn er meerdere componenten. Als best practice is het goed om de performance van elk onderdeel van het hele systeem te testen, en dan ook de hele keten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voor een afsprakenlijn zou het redelijk zijn geweest om het hele proces te testen: het oproepdoorschakelingssysteem, het afspraaksysteem, de database met gegevens en datums, de servers van elke GGD in het land, en het sturen van email en SMS-berichten met afspraak datums. Het is belangrijk om te weten of alle componenten snel samen kunnen werken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ook is er de performance van niet-computer onderdelen. De menselijke component kan ook een bottleneck zijn. Wisten de medewerkers hoe snel ze moesten vragen of een klant een afspraak wilde maken? Kunnen de testen worden uitgevoerd en de uitslagen worden gegeven, zelfs met een snelstromend afspraaksysteem? Het teveel aan afspraken toegewezen aan GGD’s kan ook files veroorzaken (zoals in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ed.nl/eindhoven/in-de-file-voor-een-stukje-zekerheid-meteen-drukte-bij-teststraat-voor-corona-in-eindhoven~a27eec83/&#34;&gt;Eindhoven&lt;/a&gt; en &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.pzc.nl/zeeuws-nieuws/drukte-bij-teststraat-in-goes-na-openstellen-nummer-voor-coronatest~aa8a6cb2/&#34;&gt;Goes&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusie&#34;&gt;Conclusie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dit geval had slechte performance een invloed niet op de winst maar op de gezondheid. Zieke personen die klachten hadden, konden niet allemaal een afspraak maken om getest te worden. Hoeveel andere mensen hadden ze inmiddels besmet? Slechte performance heeft medewerkers ook gedwongen om soms uitslagen te geven “&lt;a href=&#34;https://wnl.tv/2020/06/08/chaos-bij-de-coronalijn-personeel-slaat-alarm/&#34;&gt;in verdekte termen&lt;/a&gt;”, wat tot een privacyschending kan leiden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200704-07.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De menselijke component kan een systeem lastiger maken om te testen. Aldus &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.trouw.nl/binnenland/de-balans-na-een-week-testen-het-plan-was-mooier-dan-de-praktijk~b86399b7/&#34;&gt;Andrea Evers (LUMC)&lt;/a&gt;, hoogleraar gezondheidspsychologie:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Door de uitbraak van corona zijn mensen in een langdurige stresssituatie beland. Onzekerheid, onvoorspelbaarheid en oncontroleerbaarheid maken dat ze de behoefte hebben om zaken juist wel te controleren of voorspelbaar te maken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Als performancetesters kunnen we statistieken en een systematische aanpak combineren met kennis van de menselijke factoren om te plannen voor het onvoorspelbare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about how to ensure that Flood Element uses unique test data, using the example of a customer wanting to script unique logins for his application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, Nicole van der Hoeven here again back with another Ask a Flooder, and this week&amp;rsquo;s question is a follow-up question from last week. That user had previously asked about test data in Flood Element. This week he&amp;rsquo;s asking: &amp;ldquo;How do I ensure that Flood Element uses unique test data?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this user is actually trying to script a login for an application. He has a list of usernames and corresponding passwords that he wants to use. He&amp;rsquo;s already set both of these up in a CSV file, and he&amp;rsquo;s also set up the Element script in the same way that I outline in my previous video. However, this user is seeing errors in the test due to the application not allowing a given user account to be used simultaneously in two or more devices. The problem is that the way that he&amp;rsquo;s set it up is that he has Element running on multiple nodes, and each node has the chance to pick the same user account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how do you make sure that it&amp;rsquo;s a unique 1:1 ratio for an instance of Element and a user account in the CSV file? If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already watched the previous week&amp;rsquo;s video, you should pause this, watch that, and then come back here, so it makes a little more sense because the script that I&amp;rsquo;m using is building on what we already did in the previous week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the differences between this script and the previous week&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, I&amp;rsquo;m declaring a global variable here called &lt;code&gt;globalBrowserID&lt;/code&gt;. The idea is to create a unique and globally identifiable string that I can attach to every account in the CSV file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;globalBrowserID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;FLOOD_GRID_INDEX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;_&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;FLOOD_GRID_NODE_SEQUENCE_ID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;_&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;BROWSER_ID&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;toString&lt;/span&gt;()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global browser ID consists of three parts:- The first is a grid index, which is a number assigned to every grid, and it&amp;rsquo;s also globally unique. So if there are three grids being used in the test, then the grid indexes would be 0, 1, and 2.- The second one is a grid node sequence ID, and this is unique within the grid. The node sequence ID is a number that is assigned to every node in a single grid.- The last one is a browser ID. The browser ID is a number assigned to an instance of Element running on a single node.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are all zero-based, so the very first instance of Element running on the very first node and on the very first grid in the entire test would be &lt;code&gt;0_0_0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re going to have to modify our CSV file to make use of this browser ID. So whereas the user previously had username and password, I&amp;rsquo;ve added an ID column. From then, these will have to be sequential. So &lt;code&gt;0_0_0&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0_0_1...&lt;/code&gt; And &lt;code&gt;0_0_1&lt;/code&gt; would be the second instance of Element running still on the first node, on the first grid. And you can make as many of these as you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;id,username,password
0_0_0,user1,password1
0_0_1,user2,password2
0_0_2,user3,password3
1_0_0,user4,password4
1_0_1,user5,password5
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also modified the interface &lt;code&gt;UserData&lt;/code&gt; to describe the fields in the CSV file. So there&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;username&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;password&lt;/code&gt;, and I&amp;rsquo;ve defined them all as strings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;TestData&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;fromCSV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;UserData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;users_multiplegrids.csv&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)
  .&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;((&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;browserID&lt;/span&gt;) =&amp;gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;globalBrowserID&lt;/span&gt;)
  .&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;circular&lt;/span&gt;()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This line is telling Element to take this data file with this filename and filter it based on the line, the index, and the browserID such that &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; is equal to the browser ID. So what happens here is that Element will take the global browser ID, which let&amp;rsquo;s say is &lt;code&gt;0_0_0&lt;/code&gt; for the very first one. It&amp;rsquo;ll then take that &lt;code&gt;0_0_0&lt;/code&gt; and look at the CSV file for anything in the ID field that has the value &lt;code&gt;0_0_0&lt;/code&gt;. And then it will continue to use the rest of that line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also made the CSV file circular just because that&amp;rsquo;s always a good practice to get into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as always, I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great idea to debug this, especially when you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with multiple grids and multiple nodes on that grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Print to console&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Browser&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;UserData&lt;/span&gt;) =&amp;gt; {
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;global browser ID: &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;globalBrowserID&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;| user: &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;username&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39; | password: &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;password&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;)    
})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also added the username and password here, just in case we need to verify the state that that user is in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s run the test. Since we&amp;rsquo;re just running this locally, we&amp;rsquo;ll see that the first value indeed is &lt;code&gt;0_0_0&lt;/code&gt;, and the user we&amp;rsquo;re selecting is &lt;code&gt;user1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;password1&lt;/code&gt;, which lines up with the username and password values corresponding to &lt;code&gt;0_0_0&lt;/code&gt; in the CSV file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that helped, and until next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this video, I discuss how to make your load testing scripts more realistic by including test data. The load testing tool I use is &lt;a href=&#34;https://element.flood.io/&#34;&gt;Flood Element&lt;/a&gt;, but you can apply these principles to any tool. You&amp;rsquo;ll find a copy of the Element script I used below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/EGhVm-R12qI&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And, if you prefer, here&amp;rsquo;s the audio version:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, Nicole van der Hoeven here back with another Ask a Flooder, and this time the question is: How do I use test data with Flood Element?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s talk about why you might want to use test data. In load testing, it&amp;rsquo;s important to make your scripts behave as similarly to real users as possible so that the load that you generate is production-like. The problem is that if you send the same data over and over again to the server, that server is probably going to cache that response. The response being cached means that the server will return the response way faster than it normally would if it had been a unique request. So we can use test data, instead of static data hardcoded in your scripts, to make sure that this doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using test data can also help us test different responses. For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say we&amp;rsquo;re testing a loan application system, where a user inputs the application ID, the server looks it up, and returns the status of that loan application. Now, loan applications might be in different stages of the process. For instance, some might be saved but not submitted, or maybe they&amp;rsquo;ve been submitted but failed the identity verification check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we used the same application ID every time, then the server would always return the same status and the same details. Instead, let&amp;rsquo;s create a CSV file that we can use as test data. It might look something like this.‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;applicationId
A100001
B100002
C100003
D100004
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can have &lt;code&gt;applicationId&lt;/code&gt; as the single header here, and we can populate this with a list of different application IDs in different stages of the process. That way, when we run the script, the server will have to respond authentically to every request without it being cached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to create our script. This is an empty Element script. To start with, make sure you&amp;rsquo;re importing &lt;code&gt;TestData&lt;/code&gt; here in the first line of your script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;TestSettings&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Until&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;By&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Browser&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;TestData&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;@flood/element&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing we&amp;rsquo;re going to need to do is to create an interface for the CSV file. Let&amp;rsquo;s call it &lt;code&gt;AppData&lt;/code&gt;. Within this interface, we&amp;rsquo;ll need to define all the fields that we intend to use in our data file and what type of values we can expect to be in those fields. Looking at our CSV here, we&amp;rsquo;ve just got the application ID, so I&amp;rsquo;m just going to copy that, and it&amp;rsquo;s a mixture of characters and numbers, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to put that in as a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;AppData&lt;/span&gt; {
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;applicationId&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;    
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we need to tell Element how to find this test data. We&amp;rsquo;ll say that it&amp;rsquo;s from the CSV, using the interface we&amp;rsquo;ve just created. Now we&amp;rsquo;ll tell Element the filename. In this situation, the CSV file that I&amp;rsquo;m using is actually in the same directory, so I don&amp;rsquo;t need to specify a path here, but if you&amp;rsquo;re putting it somewhere else, then you&amp;rsquo;ll need to specify the folder and the path to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;TestData&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;fromCSV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;AppData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;applicationids.csv&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s use the data in a step. In real life, you might want to use an application ID to type it into a text field, but for demonstration purposes, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to show you how to output it to the console log. Printing to the console is also a good way to debug your tests, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re dealing with test data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to let Element know that we want to use AppData. So now, let&amp;rsquo;s output this to the console. Since we&amp;rsquo;re just debugging, let&amp;rsquo;s output the application ID. To actually get the value from the data file, we&amp;rsquo;ll use this syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Print to console&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Browser&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;AppData&lt;/span&gt;) =&amp;gt; {
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;application ID: &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;applicationId&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;) 
})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍By default, Element reads the data files sequentially. The problem with that is we only have a handful of application IDs. So if we wanted to run this one script 100 times, we&amp;rsquo;re going to run out of data. What we can do here is add &lt;code&gt;circular&lt;/code&gt;. That way, when the script reaches the very last value of the file, the next value it selects will be the first one, and it never runs out of test data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;TestData&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;fromCSV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;AppData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;applicationids.csv&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)    
  .&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;circular&lt;/span&gt;()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing you might be wondering is how to make it so that Element chooses a random value every time. To do that, we&amp;rsquo;ll also have to add &lt;code&gt;shuffle&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;TestData&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;fromCSV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;AppData&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;applicationids.csv&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)    
  .&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;circular&lt;/span&gt;()
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍Now let&amp;rsquo;s try to run the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;element run test-data.ts
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it&amp;rsquo;s been finished. The application ID that was selected was indeed a random one because the first one would have started with A. So, it actually chose the last one randomly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s it for test data with Element. Now, this user actually had a follow-up question, which was about unique test data. I&amp;rsquo;m going to answer that in the next video. Until next time, happy Flooding!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sample-script&#34;&gt;Sample script&lt;/h2&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://guildconferences.com/speaker/nicole-hoeven/&#34;&gt;PerfGuild 2020&lt;/a&gt;, I spoke about hybrid load testing and how to mix two different approaches to load testing: protocol-based and browser-based.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/load-testing-on-the-google-cloud-platform&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/load-testing-on-the-google-cloud-platform&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re excited to welcome another cloud provider to the Flood lineup,  giving you even more options for running your load tests. You can now  use Flood to run load tests on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/&#34;&gt;Google Cloud Platform (GCP)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of you have requested an integration with Google Cloud, citing many of its strengths:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/open-source/bringing-the-best-of-open-source-to-google-cloud-customers&#34;&gt;integrations with open-source tools&lt;/a&gt; like Influx and Redis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;World-class &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/security&#34;&gt;security&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;High-performance &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/infrastructure&#34;&gt;global network&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seamless access to other apps in the Google ecosystem, such as Search and Maps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think that adding support for GCP instances opens up a lot of  opportunities for flooders wanting to take advantage of these benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;using-flood-with-google-cloud&#34;&gt;Using Flood with Google Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll notice a new Google Cloud section in &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.flood.io/account/integrations&#34;&gt;the Integrations page&lt;/a&gt; while you&amp;rsquo;re logged into Flood:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200528-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need to add your GCP service account key to allow Flood to access your  account on your behalf. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve done this, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to start  grids and floods right from the Flood interface you&amp;rsquo;re already using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details on how to set up Flood to use your GCP account, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/infrastructure/host-your-own-infrastructure/using-your-own-google-cloud-account&#34;&gt;our documentation&lt;/a&gt; or follow along with the video below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oYTo0jwRfMo&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a Flood subscription, including a free one, can use Google Cloud instances at no extra cost from Flood; however, GCP usage  may incur separate costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GCP is the third cloud provider that we support at Flood, after &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/infrastructure/host-your-own-infrastructure/using-your-own-aws-account&#34;&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/infrastructure/host-your-own-infrastructure/using-your-own-azure-account&#34;&gt;Microsoft Azure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, Nicole van der Hoeven here again, back with another Ask a Flooder, and today&amp;rsquo;s question is: &amp;ldquo;How do I install Element?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I already made a previous video on how to get started with Element, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually go into the details of how to install it, so that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m going to do in this video today. There are actually a few parts to installing Element, and all of these instructions are going to be on &lt;a href=&#34;http://element.flood.io/&#34;&gt;element.flood.io&lt;/a&gt;. If you go onto the site and click on Install, you&amp;rsquo;ll see all of the instructions depending on which operating system you&amp;rsquo;re on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you need to install NodeJS. This is sort of like how, if you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with JMeter, you have to install Java before installing JMeter. NodeJS is what Element runs on. Secondly, you&amp;rsquo;ll need a package manager. You can use NPM or Yarn, but in this video, I&amp;rsquo;m going to take you through how to do it with Yarn. And thirdly, there&amp;rsquo;s installing Element itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, download NodeJS. I&amp;rsquo;m going to leave links in the description to all of the sites that I visit so that you can go through all of the instructions later. On the Node site, download whichever installer suits your operating system. Go through the installation steps, and afterwards, check to make sure that NodeJS is properly installed on your machine. You can do that by going into the terminal and typing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;node -v
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just make sure that the version that&amp;rsquo;s shown here is the same version that you&amp;rsquo;ve downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, install the latest version of Yarn. On the Yarn site, you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to choose your operating system and the version. We recommend using the latest stable version. And then go through the instructions for your operating system. After you&amp;rsquo;ve done that, check your Yarn installation by typing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;yarn --version
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the last step is installing Element. On the Element site, you can find the exact code that you need to type into your terminal. It&amp;rsquo;s:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;yarn global add @flood/element-cli 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you can just copy that into your terminal. As of the time of this recording, the latest version of Element is 1.2.3. Looks like that&amp;rsquo;s installed. To check the version of Element, type:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;element --version
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that&amp;rsquo;s how to install Element. We&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a lot of questions recently about Element in particular, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to answering them in future videos. Hope this helped, and until next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/on-premise-load-testing-advantages-and-disadvantages&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/on-premise-load-testing-advantages-and-disadvantages&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where you run your load test can affect the results that you get as well as your project&amp;rsquo;s bottom line. In general, there are two infrastructure options to consider for load testing your apps: on-premise and cloud. Which type of environment is best for load testing both web or mobile apps?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;differences-between-on-premise-and-cloud-load-testing&#34;&gt;Differences between on-premise and cloud load testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-on-premise-load-testing&#34;&gt;What is on-premise load testing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-premise load testing is running your performance or load testing scripts on load generators you physically control. Typically, these load generators are machines that are either in your office or data center. In on-premise load testing, you are responsible for all aspects of the maintenance of the load generators, including hardware upgrades and software installations such as testing tools, but that also comes with increased control and security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-cloud-load-testing&#34;&gt;What is cloud load testing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cloud load testing, you run your load tests on a service provider&amp;rsquo;s machines, effectively outsourcing the provisioning and maintenance of your load generators. Running &amp;ldquo;on the cloud&amp;rdquo; means you&amp;rsquo;re paying someone else to be responsible for these machines. In cloud load testing, you don&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;own&amp;rdquo; the machines your test is running on; it&amp;rsquo;s more like renting some time on someone&amp;rsquo;s data center whenever you need it. Cloud-based infrastructure isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily less secure than on-premise infrastructure, but there are certainly more security considerations to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pros-and-cons-of-on-premise-load-testing&#34;&gt;Pros and cons of on-premise load testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-premise load testing is no better or worse than cloud load testing; it just depends on what you need. There&amp;rsquo;s a meme that the cloud is just a fancy term for someone else&amp;rsquo;s computer— but &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zdnet.com/article/stop-saying-the-cloud-is-just-someone-elses-computer-because-its-not/&#34;&gt;that&amp;rsquo;s an oversimplification&lt;/a&gt; that glosses over nuances that might make a difference to your bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some questions to ask yourself when deciding between load testing on the cloud or on-premise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200430-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Test infrastructure can make or break your load tests.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud-vs-on-premise-load-testing-how-do-you-decide&#34;&gt;Cloud vs. on-premise load testing: how do you decide?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-are-you-running-a-load-test&#34;&gt;Why are you running a load test?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your intention for running load tests is to test your web application&amp;rsquo;s load balancing, the source of the web traffic, and the location of your environment, may not be as important. If you intend to do stress testing, you may want the scalability of a cloud setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;who-is-the-intended-audience-of-your-application&#34;&gt;Who is the intended audience of your application?‍&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing is most accurate when it is as realistic to the production workload and user base as possible. Running a load test on-premises means that the traffic comes from one location, which could be ideal if your application is an internal one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 id=&#34;do-you-have-the-resources-in-your-teamcompany-to-maintain-load-generators&#34;&gt;Do you have the resources in your team/company to maintain load generators?&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All machines need to be provisioned, set up, and maintained to function correctly. Depending on how many machines you need, you may even need a team of trained professionals to monitor your environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-is-your-budget&#34;&gt;What is your budget?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both cloud and on-premise load testing have costs. Cloud load testing requires a smaller outlay of cash initially but may cost more to maintain as you continue to pay for the computing time. On-premise load testing requires more money upfront but may cost less to maintain in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-many-virtual-users-do-you-want-to-run&#34;&gt;How many virtual users do you want to run?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of virtual users you intend to test your application against correlates to the number of load generators you require. In general, the more machines you need, the more expensive it becomes (for both cloud and on-premise load testing), but if you only need a handful of users, perhaps you can find a machine or two on-premise that could do the trick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;advantages-of-on-premise-load-testing&#34;&gt;Advantages of on-premise load testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍
&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200430-02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;increased-control&#34;&gt;Increased control&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since you own the machines you&amp;rsquo;re testing on, you can set your environment up with your exact specifications in mind. You&amp;rsquo;ll be able to make hardware upgrades or update versions of operating systems and load testing tools whenever you want, without needing to liaise with a third-party provider. This option can come in handy if you routinely use non-standard configurations or legacy software. If you&amp;rsquo;re also doing other types of non-functional testing, like security testing, it may be easier to change the configuration on on-premise machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;greater-data-security&#34;&gt;Greater data security&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question of cloud vs. on-premises may be a business decision. Some industries or businesses with stringent compliance and regulatory requirements may have no choice but to run tests on-premise because owning the load generators also means controlling who has access to the data that&amp;rsquo;s on them. An on-premise environment lets you lock down access if necessary. With cloud load testing, you&amp;rsquo;d need to have security arrangements with the cloud provider that you choose so that any test data or identifying client information seen or accessed by your test scripts remains confidential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;lower-cost-and-lower-barrier-to-entry-in-some-situations&#34;&gt;Lower cost and lower barrier to entry in some situations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t intend to run too many users of your test script and you already have a spare machine or two at the office, on-premise load testing may be the easiest and most cost-effective way to get started. This way, you avoid having to request the budget for a new tool and needing to train your team on a new interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;fewer-variations-due-to-latency&#34;&gt;Fewer variations due to latency&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Controlling your own load generators means controlling the network they run on. If your corporate network is generally stable, and your test scenarios don&amp;rsquo;t involve testing from different geographical locations, reported response times (and user experience) more closely reflect server processing time rather than latency and travel time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;disadvantages-of-on-premise-load-testing&#34;&gt;Disadvantages of on-premise load testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍
&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200430-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;higher-cost-in-some-situations&#34;&gt;Higher cost in some situations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining your own load generators comes with a higher up-front cost, which may be a showstopper for smaller projects or companies. The more concurrent users you require for your load test, the more machines you need, the more licenses you need for your testing tool (unless it&amp;rsquo;s open source), and the longer it takes to recover your investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;geographical-limitations&#34;&gt;Geographical limitations&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since all your machines are in one place, you can&amp;rsquo;t accurately simulate the user experience for customers who might access your web app from another location. You also can&amp;rsquo;t fully test the effect of CDNs and other tools that your application might employ to keep response times low. Web apps that can be accessed by anyone on the internet might require performance tests that take into account customers from different regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;more-setup&#34;&gt;More setup&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to do all the setup yourself for both hardware and software components. You also need a way to coordinate your test, so that load generators start and end when you want them to. You may want to divert some resources towards environment management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;less-flexibility&#34;&gt;Less flexibility&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With on-premise load generators, you can&amp;rsquo;t add, remove, or scale up nodes on the fly according to your test— something cloud load testing excels at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-premise-load-testing-best-practices&#34;&gt;On-premise load testing best practices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environment you&amp;rsquo;re testing in is especially important when you&amp;rsquo;re using your own infrastructure. Here are some best practices for a performance testing strategy that involves on-premise load generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;run-baseline-tests&#34;&gt;Run baseline tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treat load testing like a scientific experiment. Before you begin changing variables to improve performance, spend some time figuring out your test configuration so that it&amp;rsquo;s repeatable. Pay attention to things like workloads, business processes, the number of users you&amp;rsquo;re running per load generator, test environment configuration values, script pacing and think time set in your testing tool, and test script transactions. Make sure that the resource utilization on your machines remains healthy during a test; otherwise, you&amp;rsquo;re load testing the load generators themselves rather than your application servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, run a few tests against your application servers without making any changes. This way, you create a &amp;ldquo;control group&amp;rdquo; or control test against which to compare future tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This process is called &lt;em&gt;baselining&lt;/em&gt; your application performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200430-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Flood&amp;rsquo;s Project View lets you track an application&amp;rsquo;s performance over time and compare recent tests to a baseline&lt;/em&gt;
‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;consider-using-containers-or-virtual-machine-images&#34;&gt;Consider using containers or virtual machine images&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the lines of reducing variables, it&amp;rsquo;s especially important to use load generators that are as identical as you can make them. You can manually check that you&amp;rsquo;re installing the same software and tools on each one, or you can do as cloud providers do and automate this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to miss software that are necessary for monitoring or the load testing tool you&amp;rsquo;re using. For example, JMeter and Gatling require certain versions of Java. Test automation or browser-level load testing tools might require web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container&#34;&gt;containers such as Docker&lt;/a&gt; to create a standalone package of everything you need for your  test. Alternatively, if you&amp;rsquo;re using virtual machines, you can also create a full system image that you can use for every virtual machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between the two is that a container lets you be more granular about what is included in the package that you then deploy to all your load generators. Virtual machines include hardware components that you can set, whereas containers are software-only, decreasing package sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using containers or images allows you to keep your load generators as identical as possible (in terms of hardware and software) so that you can assume similar results from each one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200430-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dont-neglect-monitoring&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t neglect monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to forget that your application servers aren&amp;rsquo;t the only ones that need monitoring. Your load generators need monitoring as well, so that they don&amp;rsquo;t end up being the bottleneck in your tests. Here&amp;rsquo;s  &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/blog/load-testing-tutorial-server-monitoring&#34;&gt;a starter list of server metrics&lt;/a&gt; that you should consider monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might also consider how you can integrate &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackify.com/mistakes-evaluating-application-performance-management/&#34;&gt;performance management&lt;/a&gt; tools you already use into your monitoring strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;spend-time-on-a-framework-for-gathering-data&#34;&gt;Spend time on a framework for gathering data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges in on-premise load testing is figuring out how to get data from your tests. Each machine runs your test script independently of the others, so at the end of your test, you&amp;rsquo;re likely to end up with several results files. After you download these off every machine, how do you combine them into a single summary?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manually collating results is an option, but it&amp;rsquo;s a tedious one. You can copy all the files into one directory and then concatenate them so that you end up with one giant one. Depending on the size of those results files and how long you ran the test, however, this may not be feasible. For larger files, you might consider aggregating the data and increasing the granularity, so that instead of seeing raw response time for every transaction, you only see the average response time for every 15 seconds. You can use a tool like &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elastic.co/logstash&#34;&gt;Logstash&lt;/a&gt; for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It takes some time and technical expertise to set up a framework for results gathering that works for your purposes, especially if you want to go a step further and have real-time results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can also skip this part by just using the framework we&amp;rsquo;ve already set up on Flood. Tim Koopmans, our co-founder, created the first prototype of what would become Flood specifically because he got tired of having to set up this framework for every engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-run-an-on-premise-load-test-with-flood-agent&#34;&gt;How to run an on-premise load test with Flood Agent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍
The easiest way to get started with an on-premise load test is by using &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/blog/introducing-flood-agent-standalone-infrastructure-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;Flood Agent&lt;/a&gt;. Flood Agent is an executable that you can install onto a machine that effectively turns it into a full-fledged load generator.     Then, you can start a test from the Flood web interface and have your test script start running on your machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agent takes care of a few typical problems we&amp;rsquo;ve discussed so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It uses containers to ensure that load generators are identically provisioned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It automatically gathers CPU, memory, and network metrics on load generators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It coordinates the execution of the load test so that you only need to start it from one central place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It enables real-time monitoring of results while the test is running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It aggregates and collates all the results for you into a dashboard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We think Agent addresses pain points that we&amp;rsquo;ve seen over and over again in our own on-premise performance testing projects as well as in our customers&#39;. Agent is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/flood-io/flood-agent/releases/latest&#34;&gt;free download&lt;/a&gt; and works with &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/scripting-and-tools/choosing-a-tool&#34;&gt;all performance testing tools that Flood supports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-premise load testing is still a valid option despite the growth in popularity of cloud-based infrastructure, and it has its advantages and disadvantages. This type of load testing trades a little bit of flexibility for increased data security and control, which is a tradeoff that some companies may be willing to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-premise load testing has traditionally included a lot of tedious setup and maintenance. Still, you can reduce maintenance effort by creating an internal load testing framework upfront that automates coordination, monitoring, and results collection. Using Flood Agent can mitigate time spent on this initial setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-13-how-do-you-do-mobile-load-testing&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-13-how-do-you-do-mobile-load-testing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you load test a native mobile app? I discuss the general approach to mobile load testing, what a device farm is, and why a device farm isn&amp;rsquo;t necessary for load testing. I also discuss the best mobile load testing tools to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_rRu0cDey4&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or listen to the audio version here:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/2fevtJd7pPIAUDkMpdnzkV&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;232&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, Nicole here again, back with another Ask a Flooder, and today&amp;rsquo;s question is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-you-do-mobile-load-testing&#34;&gt;How do you do mobile load testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this question came from a customer who was under the misconception that in order to do mobile load testing, they would need to use what we call a device farm. A device farm is a collection of different kinds of mobile phones. You would ideally have the most popular makes of mobile phones (the hardware models) and the operating systems and system versions. You can imagine that this can very easily get a little out of hand to coordinate because of fragmentation. There are just so many devices out on the market, and then there&amp;rsquo;s the question of how you actually generate the load from that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would somehow need some sort of test automation script that was running and then coordinate os that they all run at the same time, and you would use that as a load test. As you can imagine, whether you use real devices or simulators, this kind of thing would get complicated and expensive very quickly. But the good news is that it&amp;rsquo;s unnecessary if it&amp;rsquo;s load testing that you want to do. Now I say that because, for functional testing or compatibility testing, you ARE going to want to test your application on a variety of different browsers. But with load testing, you&amp;rsquo;re really more concerned about the back end part of the equation. You want to generate load on your application servers. In reality, most mobile apps work by sending API requests to that server, usually by some sort of restful API. Luckily, API load testing has been around for a while, so we do have some industry-tested ways to run this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-best-tools-for-api-load-testing&#34;&gt;What are the best tools for API load testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially, you&amp;rsquo;re going to want to test protocol-level tools. That means that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be using browser-level tools in which you&amp;rsquo;re using scripts to drive a full browser. All you really need is something that sends requests on the protocol-level. That&amp;rsquo;s great because it&amp;rsquo;s actually way more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have two really good open-source options for this, JMeter and Gatling. I&amp;rsquo;ve already gone a little bit into the differences between these two in my previous video on how you choose a tool for load testing, which I will leave a link to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here are some other resources that will help you get started with mobile load testing. I also have another video about how to record network traffic from a native mobile app on JMeter, which sounds a little complicated, but I promise it&amp;rsquo;s not. In that video, I go over the steps with you, and I&amp;rsquo;m actually doing it in real-time with you as well. I show you the screen recording from my mobile and from JMeter on my laptop, so you can always pause and watch it at your own pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing is that I already wrote a blog post, which is sort of a guide for mobile load testing, which goes into the steps into way more detail than I can here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly, I have written blog posts about two real-life examples of mobile load testing. The first one was the Iowa Caucus Reporter app. I ran through it from the workload modeling to the scripting and then the actual execution. More recently, I also wrote about the Robinhood app. Be sure to check out the links in the description to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/browser-based-load-testing-in-2020&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/browser-based-load-testing-in-2020&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/blog/level-up-your-load-testing-with-browser-level-users&#34;&gt;first announced&lt;/a&gt; our open-source browser-based load testing tool based on Puppeteer, &lt;a href=&#34;https://element.flood.io/&#34;&gt;Flood Element&lt;/a&gt;, in February 2018. Despite our decision to make it an entirely separate tool from Flood, we&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed using it so much as a team that several of us have written about it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim Koopmans: &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/blog/load-testing-for-devops-with-browser-level-users-blu&#34;&gt;Load testing for DevOps&amp;hellip; with Browser Level Users (BLU)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Dunne: &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/blog/a-new-approach-to-load-testing-with-browser-level-users&#34;&gt;A new approach to load testing with browser level users&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;me: &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/blog/prepare-for-viral-videos-with-flood-element&#34;&gt;Prepare for viral videos with Flood Element&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lachie Cox: &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/blog/why-you-should-load-test-with-browsers&#34;&gt;Why should you load test with real browsers?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;our friend Eduardo Riol, as translated by Antonio Jimenez: &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/blog/selenium-vs-puppeteer-for-test-automation-is-a-new-leader-emerging&#34;&gt;Puppeteer vs. Selenium for test automation: is a new leader emerging?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, we&amp;rsquo;re huge fans of load testing a web application with real browsers. But does the wider software testing industry share that sentiment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;browser-based-load-testing-in-2020&#34;&gt;Browser-based load testing in 2020&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browser-level load testing is still pretty new, and there aren&amp;rsquo;t too many providers offering it right now. Luckily, we just so happen to have access to a database of load tests run on Flood since 2013. Here&amp;rsquo;s a bar chart visualizing data we&amp;rsquo;ve collected about the load testing tools flooders have used (we support Selenium, JMeter, Gatling, and Element).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;load-tests-executed-on-flood-over-time-grouped-by-load-testing-tool&#34;&gt;Load tests executed on Flood over time, grouped by load testing tool&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200423-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;browser-level-load-testing-is-increasing-in-popularity&#34;&gt;Browser-level load testing is increasing in popularity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;in-2020-almost-35-of-the-load-tests-run-on-flood-are-browser-based-load-tests&#34;&gt;In 2020, almost 35% of the load tests run on Flood are browser-based load tests.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the total number of load tests run across all tools increased across the board, the percentage of tests that utilized Selenium and Element, as compared to JMeter and Gatling, has also increased from 2018. Both Selenium and Element are browser-based load testing tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, JMeter, a protocol-level load testing tool which previously enjoyed a 70% share of the traffic on Flood, now accounts for only a bit over 50% of usage. JMeter&amp;rsquo;s share of the protocol-level pie is higher than Gatling&amp;rsquo;s, but the percentage of usage for both tools appears to be contracting when compared to that of browser-based tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;element-use-is-increasing-faster-than-selenium-use&#34;&gt;Element use is increasing faster than Selenium use&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that Selenium has been around longer, &lt;strong&gt;25% of all floods today are run using Element&lt;/strong&gt;. This is a significant increase in just two years, and one that bodes well for the future. While we&amp;rsquo;re still fans of Selenium and still support it, one reason we see for the dominance of Element in today&amp;rsquo;s market is resource efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our baseline tests, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen that Element can run from 20-50 users per Flood node (an &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/m5-the-next-generation-of-general-purpose-ec2-instances/&#34;&gt;AWS m5.xlarge instance&lt;/a&gt;), whereas Selenium can only run up to 5. This leads to some significant cost savings, as running the same number of users with Element requires fewer load generators than with Selenium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another reason might be the fact that Element uses Puppeteer in the background. Puppeteer, developed by Google, understandably shines when driving Google Chrome (and recently, Firefox). Puppeteer load testing is growing in popularity due to the wealth of metrics it has access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-browser-based-load-testing-works&#34;&gt;How browser-based load testing works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional load testing is done on the protocol level by sending messages directly to the web server. These messages are sent without simulating the application interface, and the responses that are received from the server are not visualized, either. &amp;ldquo;Users&amp;rdquo; in protocol-level load testing scripts are actually threads, with each one sending a list of messages at predefined intervals, and we refer to these users as Protocol-Level Users (PLU). JMeter and Gatling use PLU to generate load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screenshot below shows what one request for a single action might look like in a JMeter test plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200423-02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Example of an HTTP request with parameters on JMeter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In browser-based load testing, real browser instances are opened on load generators, and the load testing tool plays the part of a real user in navigating the web application using the GUI. We refer to the virtual users in browser-based load testing as Browser-Level Users (BLU).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of the same action in the JMeter example above, but this time in an Element test script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;Step 1&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt; =&amp;gt; {
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;//Click Start button
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;startButton&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;findElement&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;.btn-default&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)
    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;startButton&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;click&lt;/span&gt;()
})
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This version simply describes the button to be found and clicked, whereas the protocol-level version needs to be more precise in what exactly is passed to the server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both types of load testing tools can apply the same load on an application (as long as it supports both methods— see the next section). The main difference is in how the load is generated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A protocol-level script will contain instructions on which messages to send, which protocols to use, which headers to include, and other information that a typical end-user would not see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A browser-level script will contain instructions on how to &lt;em&gt;interact&lt;/em&gt; with the application: which buttons to click, what to type in text fields, which links to follow, and other on-screen elements that an end-user would be familiar with. This leads us to one of the big advantages of browser-based load testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;pros-and-cons-of-browser-based-load-testing&#34;&gt;Pros and cons of browser-based load testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pros&#34;&gt;Pros&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;simple-scripting-or-no-scripting-at-all&#34;&gt;Simple scripting— or no scripting at all&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protocol-level tools require in-depth knowledge about how an application works, what format it expects requests to be in, and how it responds. On the browser-level, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to know any of that. When scripting a login process, for instance, you just need to tell the script to type a username and password in the right fields and then click Log In. The script doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to know that the form submits an encrypted request using the Auth0 API (something you&amp;rsquo;d need to know for a protocol-level script).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, you might be able to get away with using something like our &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/blog/record-load-tests-in-flood-element-using-qtest-explorer&#34;&gt;qTest Explorer plugin&lt;/a&gt; to record a business process, generating a script without any scripting at all. Even when you have to write or modify the script, though, it&amp;rsquo;s a lot less intimidating than most protocol-level scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re also easier to troubleshoot. In addition to opening a real browser instance on your computer when you run a script locally, Element can also display this information on the console (shown here on iTerm):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200423-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Screenshots upon execution on Element using iTerm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍This allows you to understand what&amp;rsquo;s going on in the script and in the application, letting you detect bottlenecks faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;reduced-test-complexity&#34;&gt;Reduced test complexity&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The streamlined requirements for scripting lead to a straightforward test. There&amp;rsquo;s no chance of getting request parameters or values wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ability-to-test-entire-stack-from-the-user-perspective&#34;&gt;Ability to test entire stack from the user perspective&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike testing APIs, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to decide which server you want to hit or make sure you have the appropriate requests to hit all the servers. A browser-level test script interacts with page elements like a real user would, so all underlying application servers are tested. Pair this with &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/infrastructure/demand-infrastructure/advantages-of-testing-in-the-cloud&#34;&gt;cloud-based infrastructure on Flood&lt;/a&gt;, and you&amp;rsquo;ve got a compact package for testing your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;capable-of-testing-any-user-behavior&#34;&gt;Capable of testing any user behavior&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protocol-level load test tools struggle with some types of applications, such as single-page apps (SPAs), where a lot of the processing is done on the client side. Browser-level load testing tools shine here, because scripted interactions for these apps are no different for SPAs than other web apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;record-network-and-user-interaction-times-for-front-end-optimization&#34;&gt;Record network and user interaction times for front-end optimization&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browser-level tools show you response times from the user&amp;rsquo;s perspective: how long after a user clicks the log in button does the user see his or her account balance? This metric is a practical one that may differ wildly from the traditional response times that a protocol-level tool reports. Measuring real user experience is a great value add for your test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;easier-to-maintain&#34;&gt;Easier to maintain&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower script complexity means that a browser-based test script is more resilient to changes in the codebase. A change in the underlying requests sent will not require a change in the test script, making it perfect for regression testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also easier to pass on to other members of the team due to high readability. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of how to select a value from a dropdown menu in Element:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;selectByValue&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;#challenger_age&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;34&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easy to see that the script is looking for an element with the ID &amp;ldquo;challenger_age&amp;rdquo; and selecting the value &amp;ldquo;34&amp;rdquo;. This step could correspond to dozens of requests that need to be scripted if testing on the protocol level, which makes those scripts harder to understand without a proper handover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cons&#34;&gt;Cons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Browser-based load testing tools have a higher CPU and memory footprint than protocol-based tools. Test scripts in JMeter and Gatling send messages to and record responses from a server without really needing to parse responses. By contrast, browser-based tools parse the server response in order to access the Domain Object Model (DOM) elements on the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using real browsers might be closer to the real user experience, but it also takes its toll on node resources. It is possible to run in headless mode, where browsers are started &amp;ldquo;invisibly&amp;rdquo; without actually graphically rendering them. However, even then, a browser-level tool can run fewer concurrent users on a node than a protocol-level tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;best-tools-and-applications-for-browser-based-load-testing&#34;&gt;Best tools and applications for browser-based load testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While other commercial tools exist for this, we&amp;rsquo;re partial to open source tools at Flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;selenium&#34;&gt;Selenium&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200423-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selenium load testing is appealing because Selenium is already well-known for test automation and functional testing, and a lot of companies already have full test suites in Selenium. The possibility of reusing those resources and just running them at scale as load tests is, by far, the most compelling reason to use Selenium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;puppeteer&#34;&gt;Puppeteer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200423-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s just getting started with Puppeteer, and the amount of metrics it exposes is exciting: it seems like anything in Chrome Developer Tools can be accessed by Puppeteer. Imagine running a load test on ONE tool that gives you statistics about back-end performance (response times, the effect of bandwidth restrictions, resources returning errors) AND front-end performance (client-side script console logs, render times, time to first paint, etc). It&amp;rsquo;s hard to imagine a future where this ISN&amp;rsquo;T a valuable tool in the performance arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Puppeteer, of course, is &lt;a href=&#34;https://element.flood.io/&#34;&gt;Element&lt;/a&gt;— our load-flavored version of Puppeteer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200423-06.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;is-protocol-based-load-testing-dead&#34;&gt;Is protocol-based load testing dead?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. Testing on the protocol-level may have its drawbacks, but it&amp;rsquo;s popular for a reason. If you&amp;rsquo;re testing mobile apps or API endpoints, protocol-level testing tools allow you to focus on hitting what you want to test and only what you want to test. Sometimes you don&amp;rsquo;t want to test the whole stack. It really depends on your test scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, protocol-level tools tend to be really resource efficient. We&amp;rsquo;ve been able to easily run about 1000 users per Flood node with JMeter and Gatling, easily outstripping browser-level tools. It makes sense, since JMeter and Gatling don&amp;rsquo;t need to start browser instances to generate load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s significantly cheaper to generate very high loads with protocol-level tools. This efficiency makes protocol-level tools a good choice for high concurrency load testing and especially stress testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-we-doing-to-support-blu&#34;&gt;What are we doing to support BLU?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, our usage metrics show that browser-based load testing is on the rise, and we&amp;rsquo;re planning to ramp up our offerings in this area while also maintaining support for protocol-level tools. Here&amp;rsquo;s what you can look forward to from us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New releases
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We just released &lt;a href=&#34;https://element.flood.io/docs/1.0/install&#34;&gt;version 1.2.3 of Element&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks ago, which addresses some bugs and improve stability for certain actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dedicated Element team
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve put together a team of developers who will be focusing on improving Element exclusively. Despite Element being an open source tool, we&amp;rsquo;re putting our own resources behind it to improve it faster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partnering with consulting services
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can be difficult to get started on a new tool, and Element is no exception. While we provide a load testing platform to run Element scripts, some companies want help to create the scripts in the first place. To this end, we&amp;rsquo;ve partnered with expert consultants who have already been using Element with great success: &lt;a href=&#34;https://foulkconsulting.com/&#34;&gt;Foulk Consulting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.planittesting.com/&#34;&gt;Planit Testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When choosing a performance testing tool, it&amp;rsquo;s important to consider the advantages and disadvantages of protocol-level and browser-level testing tools. We think both types of tools deserve to be in a solid performance and load testing strategy. They can also be used in tandem in a hybrid load testing approach, improving overall application performance and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, we predicted that testing web-based applications with real browsers would increase in popularity, so we&amp;rsquo;re thrilled to see our theory validated in 2020. Browser-based load testing is increasing in usage, and our open source tool, Element, is leading the charge. It&amp;rsquo;s exciting to be at the forefront of this revolution, and we intend to increase support for load testing with real browsers even more this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-12-puppeteer-vs-selenium-which-one-is-better-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to software testing, the debate of Puppeteer vs Selenium is a hot one. Nicole tackles it here to determine which one is better for load testing in particular. Spoiler: The answer is still &amp;ldquo;it depends&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/K61W7ivhsuE&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or catch the audio version here:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/76u25lI7sFx5SwgbsFLU5Z&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;232&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, Nicole here again, back for another Ask a Flooder, and today, the question is: &amp;ldquo;Puppeteer vs. Selenium: which one is better for load testing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re actually getting this quite a bit now as Puppeteer grows in popularity, but first, let&amp;rsquo;s discuss the similarities. They&amp;rsquo;re tools that you can use to drive browsers. The work by identifying and interacting with elements on a website in the same way that a user would. They are also both open-source, and both can be used for load testing. This is a great strategy because instead of writing tests for an automation suite and then tests for load testing, you can just write the one test suite and re-use it, so it saves a lot of resources in the end. To answer this question, I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus on load testing because that&amp;rsquo;s what my experience is in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;difference-between-selenium-and-puppeteer&#34;&gt;Difference between Selenium and Puppeteer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pros-and-cons-of-selenium&#34;&gt;Pros and cons of Selenium&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the difference. Selenium supports more browsers than does Puppeteer. It supports Chrome, Firefox, IE, Safari, and Opera, so there are a lot more options to choose from depending on your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selenium is also what I would call automation-first. It was built with automation in mind, which means it&amp;rsquo;s very good at that. It&amp;rsquo;s very robust, and if you have a complicated test scenario, Selenium is an excellent choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also been around for much longer than Puppeteer, which is important because that means it&amp;rsquo;s had more time to build up a community. There are way more resources and tutorials for Selenium than for Puppeteer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also, unfortunately, very resource-intensive. That&amp;rsquo;s not something that you would typically care too much about from a test automation perspective, but when you&amp;rsquo;re running thousands of users on the cloud, it IS important to keep in mind that Selenium, just because of how it&amp;rsquo;s built and its complexity, can only run about five users per node. We&amp;rsquo;ve found that out at Flood, after baselining specifically an AWS m5.xlarge instance. So you can look at the specs of that and compare it with the machines that you&amp;rsquo;re wanting to run Selenium on, to see how that would equate for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pros-and-cons-of-puppeteer&#34;&gt;Pros and cons of Puppeteer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puppeteer is a NodeJS library developed by Google, which means it plays very well with Chrome. There are a whole lot of things that you have access to with Puppeteer, and if you&amp;rsquo;re using it with Chrome, pretty much anything in Chrome, including rendering times, you can see and access with a Puppeteer script. So that&amp;rsquo;s a huge advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that also means it supports fewer browsers. Obviously, it supports Chrome very well, and they recently came out with support for Firefox, although they do have plans to incorporate support for more browsers in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Puppeteer&amp;rsquo;s advantages is that we at Flood actually created a tool on top of Puppeteer. It&amp;rsquo;s also open-source. It&amp;rsquo;s called Flood Element, and Element is built to be performance-first because obviously, that&amp;rsquo;s what we had in mind when we were building it. It takes everything that&amp;rsquo;s good about Puppeteer and makes it really easy to set parameters that you normally would expect to need for load testing, like users and ramp-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This also means that it&amp;rsquo;s way less resource-intensive. I said that with Selenium, you can run up to five users on an AWS m5.xlarge instance, and for the same instance type, you can run, from our experiments, anywhere from 30-50 Element scripts/users. That is a huge saving when you&amp;rsquo;re running a really large-scale test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;should-you-choose-selenium-or-puppeteer-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;Should you choose Selenium or Puppeteer for load testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would say that if you already have a large Selenium automation suite, if you have a complex test scenario, or if you aren&amp;rsquo;t running that many users for your load test, then Selenium is a great choice. If you ARE running thousands of users, though, and resource efficiency, and therefore cost efficiency, is really important to you, then choose Element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My advice is always to try both. If you have the time, do a proof of concept with both of them. That way, your whole team can better understand what the pros and cons are for each one and decide which one is best going forward. Or maybe you don&amp;rsquo;t even decide on one. At Flood, we support both of them at the same price, so it depends on what you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-11-what-are-the-best-jmeter-plugins&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about how to install the JMeter Plugin Manager as well as other plugins, what the best JMeter plugins are, and why you need them. JMeter is an open-source load testing tool that is already robust, but there are some fantastic plugins that have been developed for it that you might want to use in your next load test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, Nicole here, back again for another Ask a Flooder, and I hope everybody is staying alert, not anxious, during these crazy times. In today&amp;rsquo;s Ask a Flooder, our customer asks: &amp;ldquo;What are the best JMeter plugins?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-jmeter-plugin&#34;&gt;What is a JMeter plugin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So first, I want to talk about what a JMeter plugin is and how you can actually install one. Apache JMeter is a really great, robust load testing that is one of my personal favorites. There are still some things that could be done better or could be extended, and the great thing about being an open-source tool is that anybody, pretty much, can just jump in and develop these plugins for JMeter to extend functionality, so that it supports more protocols or to customize load profiles in a way that is easier. We already have &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/blog/jmeter-plugins-the-top-10-plugins-and-how-they-help&#34;&gt;a blog post on this&lt;/a&gt;, and I will leave a link to that article as well in the description because it goes into a lot more detail. However, I still want to give you my personal top 3 JMeter plugins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-you-install-a-jmeter-plugin&#34;&gt;How do you install a JMeter plugin?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can install a plugin for JMeter in two ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One is to download it from &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter-plugins.org/&#34;&gt;JMeter Plugins&lt;/a&gt;, which I will give you a link to, and then you paste that into either the lib — it&amp;rsquo;s usually in the lib folder, but it could be in the ext (extensions) folder. Each plugin is going to differ as to what you need to copy into what folder, but that&amp;rsquo;s why I prefer the second method, which is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/PluginsManager/&#34;&gt;Plugin Manager&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Plugin Manager is a plugin itself, so you will initially need to do that copy and pasting of the jar file. Once you have the JMeter Plugin Manager installed, downloading and installing a plugin is as simple as choosing which ones you want and then clicking install. JMeter restarts, and that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much it. So I do recommend that the Plugin Manager be the first plugin that you install. But that&amp;rsquo;s still not my top 3 favorite - that&amp;rsquo;s just an optional step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-top-3-jmeter-plugins&#34;&gt;What are the top 3 JMeter plugins?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;custom-thread-groups&#34;&gt;Custom Thread Groups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the actual plugins. My #1 favorite is the Custom Thread Groups. See, with JMeter, you get the standard default thread group, and all that does is it asks you how many users you want to run, how many loops, the duration, and the ramp-up. That&amp;rsquo;s it. So that&amp;rsquo;s good for a lot of uses, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really help you in cases where maybe you want to plan a spike test, and you want to make sure that all the users have fully ramped up and gotten to a certain point, and then all hit the server at once. Or maybe you want to do a step load. Previously I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed stress testing and how a step load can be useful for that. In that case, the Thread Group doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite cut it because it only ramps up a user, and then it continues at the same level of load for the duration of the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you want any sort of variation in the middle (increasing users or decreasing), then you&amp;rsquo;re going to want something else.The Custom Thread Groups plugin has a lot of different types of thread groups. My favorite is the Ultimate One because you can probably do almost anything on that one. It also has the Stepping, Concurrency, Arrivals, and Free-Form Arrivals, so you have quite a few options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;throughput-shaping-timer&#34;&gt;Throughput Shaping Timer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plugin #2 is the Throughput Shaping Timer. I love it because not a lot of load testing tools, even the proprietary ones, actually have this. This is really handy when you have a project where you&amp;rsquo;re given a requirement that isn&amp;rsquo;t in terms of the number of users; it&amp;rsquo;s in terms of hits per second, or requests per second, or something to do with the actual throughput of the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with that is that the throughput tends to change, so you can&amp;rsquo;t actually take as a given that it&amp;rsquo;ll remain constant for the duration of the test. Things like response time or latency are going to affect that throughput. For instance, when you have one user or one thread that&amp;rsquo;s running, and it sends a request and receives the response back in one second, you can&amp;rsquo;t necessarily say that that&amp;rsquo;s going to be the same when there are a thousand threads doing the same thing. The server&amp;rsquo;s under more load, so maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll take five seconds instead of one second— but that&amp;rsquo;s already changed your throughput. Before, one thread was doing one request per second, and now it&amp;rsquo;s doing one request every five seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it can get a little complicated, and the Throughput Shaping Timer is one of my favorites because it promises to solve all that. The Throughput Shaping Timer dynamically changes the think time, so at the beginning of a test, for instance, when there are no response time issues and requests are being returned really quickly, it might increase the think time so that it slows down your load test. So you&amp;rsquo;re not going over that throughput that you wanted to maintain. And then later on in the test, when all the users are ramped up, then it&amp;rsquo;ll decrease the think time that it uses. So it&amp;rsquo;s great because you just have this consistent throughput throughout your test. It&amp;rsquo;s a really intelligent way to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do want to say, though, that you do also want to play around with this a bit and make sure you understand how this works. One page could have several requests in it, and you&amp;rsquo;ll want to take that into consideration when you&amp;rsquo;re choosing what to set in that timer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;http2-request-sampler&#34;&gt;HTTP/2 Request Sampler&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My #3 is the HTTP/2 Sampler. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what HTTP/2 is, it&amp;rsquo;s an upgraded or next-generation protocol to the normal HTTP that we already use. The HTTP/2 protocol is supposed to be faster and more efficient, so more and more web apps are switching to it because of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that JMeter&amp;rsquo;s HTTP request sampler is only really for HTTP sites, so the HTTP/2 sampler is an upgraded version of the HTTP sampler. It&amp;rsquo;s really easy to use. The experience is pretty much going to be the same for you, but in the background, it uses the faster HTTP/2 protocol rather than the slower one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My colleague, Jason Rizio, actually &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/blog/jmeter-tutorial-http2-test&#34;&gt;wrote a whole blog post about this&lt;/a&gt;, so if you want to learn more, I will put a link in the description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that answered your question, and until next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Introducing Flood Agent: standalone infrastructure for load testing</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20200407-introducing-flood-agent/</link>

      <description>

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/introducing-flood-agent-standalone-infrastructure-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/introducing-flood-agent-standalone-infrastructure-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working from home during this pandemic and wondering how to start load tests from the office? Today, we&amp;rsquo;re officially introducing Flood Agent, a way to turn your own physical or virtual machines into load generators that you can control from anywhere with an internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tldr&#34;&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installing Flood Agent on a machine lets you start load tests on it remotely from Flood—even if it&amp;rsquo;s within a corporate VPN.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flood Agent is a simple binary that you can install on Linux, macOS, and Windows machines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve installed Flood Agent, your machines show up on the Flood web app to use as load generators or grids.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;boldly-going-where-no-one-has-gone-before&#34;&gt;Boldly going where no one has gone before&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing within your company&amp;rsquo;s VPN and trying to coordinate it from home is like being on a maintenance pod trying to contact your starship, but a Mazarite ship is broadcasting a jamming signal, so comms are down. That Mazarite ship is your company&amp;rsquo;s firewall, and it can make testing difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The easiest way around this is to provision load generators in the cloud. However, because your application servers are still behind a firewall, you&amp;rsquo;d need to convince IT security to &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/test-execution/infrastructure/static-ip-addresses#hosted-grids&#34;&gt;whitelist the IP addresses&lt;/a&gt; of the load generators. Depending on how tight security policies are, this may not be an option even in this new world of remote working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flood Agent is a way to start load tests on Flood from the load generators you already have. It&amp;rsquo;s a cross-platform agent that you can install on your regular load generators, allowing you to control them on Flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flood Agent is kind of like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borg#Borg_Collective&#34;&gt;Borg Collective&lt;/a&gt;. Each machine that you install Flood Agent on is assimilated into the Borg. A hive mind (you, on the Flood site) controls all Borgs, coordinating test execution with robotic efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://media.giphy.com/media/J6P7vFEQ6PcgE/giphy.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out this video to follow along as I walk you through the process of setting up Flood Agent, or you can keep reading for the text version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/6VFn96aKSU8&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;installing-and-configuring-flood-agent&#34;&gt;Installing and configuring Flood Agent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flood Agent is a free binary, and it runs on Linux, Mac, or Windows machines. You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/flood-io/flood-agent/releases/latest&#34;&gt;download the appropriate version&lt;/a&gt; for your operating system and then follow the installation instructions here for more information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/infrastructure/standalone-infrastructure/getting-started-on-linux&#34;&gt;Getting started on Linux&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/infrastructure/standalone-infrastructure/getting-started-on-macos&#34;&gt;Getting started on macOS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/infrastructure/standalone-infrastructure/getting-started-on-windows&#34;&gt;Getting started on Windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After installing Flood Agent, you can configure it according to how you want to use it. Start Flood Agent in your terminal and use the configure functionality. Here&amp;rsquo;s what that command looks like on macOS, but you can follow the links above for other operating systems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;./flood-agent configure
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;linking-your-flood-account&#34;&gt;Linking your Flood account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command above yields a prompt for a token like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This token allows Flood to run load tests on the load generator that you&amp;rsquo;ve installed Flood Agent in. To get the token, go to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.flood.io/account/api&#34;&gt;API Access page&lt;/a&gt; on your Flood account (&lt;a href=&#34;https://app.flood.io/sign-up&#34;&gt;you already have one, don&amp;rsquo;t you?&lt;/a&gt;) and click REVEAL token.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-04.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should see a string of characters like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy your token (anything after the = sign) and paste it into the Flood Agent terminal window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;choosing-load-testing-tools&#34;&gt;Choosing load testing tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, you can choose which tools you&amp;rsquo;d like to set up and which version of those tools Flood Agent uses to run your tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-06.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with JMeter, Flood Agent asks you which of the tools you&amp;rsquo;d like to configure. You can choose to set up your tools at the beginning so that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to set them up again, or you can go back to this configuration wizard at any point to add another tool. Either way, you need to provide the tools that you select in one of two ways: via a Docker image supplied by Flood, or via a &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/infrastructure/standalone-infrastructure/getting-started-local-jmeter-and-gatling&#34;&gt;local installation&lt;/a&gt; that you already have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this example, I chose to configure JMeter and to use a local installation. Local installations give you the most flexibility because you can use the version of the tool that you prefer, along with any special plugins. However, if you already have Docker installed or don&amp;rsquo;t want to manually install JMeter separately, you can also use our Docker image for JMeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selecting a local installation prompts you to provide the location of that directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-07.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For JMeter, this looks something like &lt;code&gt;/Users/nvanderhoeven/jmeter/apache-jmeter-5.1.1.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you enter this file path, Flood Agent checks to make sure the directory is valid. You can also set the configuration for other tools in this dialog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-08.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you finish the configuration, the wizard writes to a config.yaml file in your Flood Agent directory. You can also edit this configuration file directly in the future if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;verifying-flood-agent-configuration&#34;&gt;Verifying Flood Agent configuration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To run a final check on whether Flood Agent has been installed correctly, type &lt;code&gt;./flood-agent check&lt;/code&gt;. You should see a summary of the configuration options you selected as well as some connectivity and validity checks, like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍
&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200407-09.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These green check marks mean you&amp;rsquo;re good to go! If you&amp;rsquo;re running Flood Agent from within a corporate network, though, you may see some errors here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;troubleshooting-network-connectivity-within-a-corporate-network&#34;&gt;Troubleshooting network connectivity within a corporate network&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your company already has a web proxy, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/infrastructure/standalone-infrastructure/deployment/integrating-with-a-web-proxy&#34;&gt;our guide on running floods through this proxy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please ensure that the load generator that you&amp;rsquo;ve installed Flood Agent on has access to the following endpoints:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;https://drain.flood.io&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;https://beacon.flood.io&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;https://vault.flood.io&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;https://flood-archives.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;https://logs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;https://sns&amp;gt;.*.amazonaws.com
&amp;lt;https://sqs&amp;gt;.*.amazonaws.com
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may need to request these from your IT department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get stuck, please contact us at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:support@flood.io&#34;&gt;support@flood.io&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;d love to go over your specific situation and get you up and running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Flood Agent returns a successful check, you can start up your own grid!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;turning-your-machine-into-a-flood-grid&#34;&gt;Turning your machine into a Flood grid&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A grid, in Flood terminology, is a group of machines to be used for load generation. To make your machine a grid, run this command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-10-what-is-the-difference-between-load-testing-and-stress-testing-video&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between load testing and stress testing? When should you choose to run a load test on your application, and when is a stress test more appropriate? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s all in the intention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/igP2q__zMcc&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, Nicole here again, back with another Ask a Flooder, and this time the question is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-difference-between-load-testing-and-stress-testing&#34;&gt;What is the difference between load testing and stress testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, again, this is a matter of semantics, but I think the difference is in the intention. Load testing and stress testing are both types of back-end performance testing, and I did also make a video on it that I&amp;rsquo;ll link in the description down below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;load-testing-is-about-seeing-how-your-server-reacts-to-finite-load&#34;&gt;Load testing is about seeing how your server reacts to finite load&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, with load testing, you usually have to start with a specific idea of the load profile that you want to test. You get to this number by looking through your Google Analytics or other analytics on your site to see what load you need to test at, and then the intention is to see how your server responds to that load. So the load is fixed: you know WHAT you want to test, and you just want to see how the server reacts to it. So it&amp;rsquo;s more finite in scope. In general, it&amp;rsquo;s also more about how your server reacts to normal or expected load, whether that&amp;rsquo;s now or in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;stress-testing-explores-your-applications-upper-limits&#34;&gt;Stress testing explores your application&amp;rsquo;s upper limits&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress testing, on the other hand, is a little bit more open-ended and a little bit more destructive. So instead of starting with how much load you want to put on [your server], in stress testing, what you generally do is you increase the load. You usually use a step load profile: so you start a certain number of users, you wait maybe 30 minutes, and then you increase it again. And you end up with this staircase kind of load profile. What you&amp;rsquo;re doing there is you just let it increase until your server fails because the intention of stress testing is to get your server to fail. And, once it fails, does it fail gracefully? Does it show an error message? These are really things that test the upper limits of your server, and that&amp;rsquo;s what stress testing really is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;they-can-be-interchangeable&#34;&gt;They can be interchangeable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Flood, we tend to use the word &amp;ldquo;load&amp;rdquo; testing to refer to both kinds of testing because both of them entail applying load on your application server. It&amp;rsquo;s not really that important to distinguish between one or another; what&amp;rsquo;s [important] is that your team uses the same definition so that when YOU say &amp;ldquo;load testing,&amp;rdquo; they know what you mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-09-what-are-the-best-tools-for-load-testing-video&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-09-what-are-the-best-tools-for-load-testing-video&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of our most commonly-asked questions is: &amp;ldquo;What are the best tools for load testing?&amp;rdquo; The answer will depend on a few things: your reason for load testing, the application you want to test, what kind of load testing you want to carry out, your team&amp;rsquo;s experience with scripting, and how many virtual users you want to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: In this video, I say that traditional load testing tools can&amp;rsquo;t simulate requests that are triggered by interactions on the client-side. This isn&amp;rsquo;t technically true: if you know what the requests are, you can build those requests manually on a protocol-level tool (like JMeter or Gatling). However, this takes more work compared to browser-level tools that just do this natively.&lt;/em&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, Nicole back again with another Ask a Flooder, and this time I&amp;rsquo;m tackling one of the questions we get asked A LOT, which is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-are-the-best-tools-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;What are the best tools for load testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-open-source-load-testing-tools-are-awesome&#34;&gt;Why open-source load testing tools are awesome&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I want to preface this by saying that we really love open-source tools here at Flood, because 1) they&amp;rsquo;re really pretty full-fledged these days. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to make any compromises on features, and, in fact, some of these open-source tools have more features than some newer load testing tools just because they&amp;rsquo;ve been out longer. And secondly, they have large communities. Because they&amp;rsquo;re open-source, lots of people are using it, and lots of people are developing for it. So there are lots of plugins normally, and they support any kind of protocol that you can think of. And lastly, cost. It&amp;rsquo;s hard not to mention cost because it can be a really important factor depending on the budget of your project. And if you&amp;rsquo;re starting out as a load tester, I think that it might even be the best way to start with load testing, because you can take that knowledge with you and apply it to other projects and other companies regardless of the budget that they have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;questions-to-ask-yourself-in-choosing-a-load-testing-tool&#34;&gt;Questions to ask yourself in choosing a load testing tool&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-are-you-doing-load-testing&#34;&gt;Why are you doing load testing?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always advocate starting with WHY. Why are you actually load testing? Is there a particular production defect that you noticed that you&amp;rsquo;re trying to solve? Is there already a problem, or are you just preparing to launch? These are things that are going to inform the type of tool that you use because you might want to make sure that that tool supports the protocols that you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-are-you-load-testing&#34;&gt;What are you load testing?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, what type of app are you testing? Because if you have a single-page app, where your end-user is interacting with the page and client-side scripts are running to make requests to servers, then that&amp;rsquo;s something that most traditional load testing tools aren&amp;rsquo;t going to be able to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two general types of load testing tools: there&amp;rsquo;s browser-based, and there&amp;rsquo;s protocol-based. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave a link in the description talking about the differences between the two, but in general, if you want to go for browser-level testing, I would suggest Selenium and Element. Now, they&amp;rsquo;re both very good options. Selenium is probably the more robust in terms of automation of the two, but Element is better one in terms of efficiency because it was built with performance in mind. So Selenium&amp;rsquo;s automation-first and Element is really performance-first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, for protocol-level tools, you can&amp;rsquo;t go wrong with either JMeter or Gatling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;what-experience-does-your-team-have-with-scripting&#34;&gt;What experience does your team have with scripting?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, what&amp;rsquo;s the level of technical expertise that your team has? I think it&amp;rsquo;s important to be realistic about what your team can do, given the amount of time that they have. So if you have a team that has never done load testing and has never done any scripting before, then I would suggest using our Test Builder or something similar. On Flood, we have a Test Builder that is really just an easy interface that actually runs JMeter under the hood, but it just kind of simplifies JMeter and boils it down to what are the URLs that you want to test. That is a really easy way to get started, and it&amp;rsquo;s also a great [way to run a] proof of concept. If you have some automation testers on your team that are trying to do the load testing, well, maybe you should stick to tools that they already use. So it might be easier for them to get up and running with either Selenium or Element rather than learning a new tool. And if you have developers on your team, you might consider Ruby JMeter rather than the vanilla JMeter because Ruby JMeter is a lot easier to deal with&amp;mdash; because you don&amp;rsquo;t have to deal with the XML files of a JMeter file (a normal JMX script). You can just plan out your load tests in Ruby. Or, Gatling is also a really good option because it allows you to write scripts in Scala. Scala is really really powerful, and you can create an entire framework with Gatling, which is also something to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;how-many-virtual-users-do-you-want-to-run-in-your-load-tests&#34;&gt;How many virtual users do you want to run in your load tests?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And lastly, how many users do you want to simulate? Now protocol-level tools are going to really shine here because Element and Selenium both require a higher usage of resources on your load generators just because of the complexities involved in starting a browser instance, whereas protocol-level tools are just super efficient at sending these requests. So I would suggest that if you&amp;rsquo;re talking about thousands of users, I would use the protocol-level tools unless there&amp;rsquo;s a really good reason why that&amp;rsquo;s not going to give you the results that you&amp;rsquo;re looking for. Between JMeter and Gatling&amp;ndash; well, they&amp;rsquo;re both excellent tools, but Gatling has been shown to particularly be good for really high levels of usage. But JMeter is also a good alternative, and you can run thousands of users of JMeter without any problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;just-get-started&#34;&gt;Just get started!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, I&amp;rsquo;d suggest just getting started. Pick whatever tool sounds like it might be the best for you, do a proof of concept on that one, and you can always try the other ones as well. On Flood, we don&amp;rsquo;t restrict you to just using one tool, so you can use one; you can use all four; you can run them at the same time if you want. It all depends on what you need for your testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ask a Flooder 08: Why is concurrent users an ambiguous measure of throughput?</title>

&lt;p&gt;What is the meaning of concurrent users in performance testing? You might have seen concurrent users in JMeter or other tools, but what does it mean and how can you use the term properly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! Nicole here again for another Ask a Flooder, except this time it&amp;rsquo;s not really a question&amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s just something I want to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200326-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: The &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/flood_io/status/1224284942932332544&#34;&gt;Flood Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m going to put the tweet up here, but last month I actually tweeted about something that somebody else posted. Netflix actually reported some of their viewership figures, and one thing that they reported was that 76 million households watched their new show, The Witcher, which is a large amount of people. So I posted something about why concurrent users is actually an ambiguous way to measure throughput, and I want to expound a little bit more on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;concurrent-users-in-performance-testing---limitations&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Concurrent users&amp;rdquo; in performance testing - limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In load testing, the number of concurrent users is a pretty standard measure of throughput, and generally, it means the number of users that are accessing an application at any one point in time. And even on Flood, we use it because it&amp;rsquo;s a really good rule of thumb. When we want to get a feel for how big a test is, load testers generally ask, &amp;ldquo;How many users?&amp;rdquo; However, we should be aware, as load testers, that that doesn&amp;rsquo;t always give us the full picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-type-of-user-is-it&#34;&gt;What type of user is it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, the type of user that it is can really change the traffic. Sometimes mobile browsers will optimize requests so that they send fewer because they realize that mobile networks are slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-the-user-doing&#34;&gt;What is the user doing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secondly, what is the user doing? Are they browsing on different tabs all the time? Or are they just refreshing the content on the same tab? Because if they&amp;rsquo;re just using the same page and fetching it over and over again, then caching could come into play, so that would create a different load on the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-long-is-the-user-doing-it&#34;&gt;How long is the user doing it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And thirdly, how long is the user doing it? Are we talking about a sustained load for an hour, or is it a shorter time period, like a spike test of five minutes where all the users just ram a system? There are things like the number of requests per second that you need to take into account, which is affected by the think time and the delays that you set in your script. Perhaps your script has a user that just sends a request, then waits for a minute, and then sends another request. That&amp;rsquo;s very different from a user just sending one request after another as fast as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-does-the-user-do-it&#34;&gt;When does the user do it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, it&amp;rsquo;s also important to take into account the seasonality of the request. When does the user do it? If you have a timesheeting application, for instance, then it might only get traffic on Fridays and a little bit on Monday, so you need to specify, when you report these numbers, whether it&amp;rsquo;s for the peak time period on Friday - you know, around 3 pm or something - or you&amp;rsquo;re reporting on figures from a Wednesday when there really wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be that many people accessing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Netflix, what they counted as a view was only a two-minute watch time. So if you&amp;rsquo;re one of those people who went into The Witcher and didn&amp;rsquo;t watch past two minutes, that still counted as a view. So the 76 million users is still not completely accurate, because not all of those people would have watched the entire thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concurrent users is a good way in order to get a quick feel of the throughput that a test outputs, but it really needs to be examined in context along with things like requests per second and the network throughput (kbps) in order to get a really good understanding of how much load a test is generating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-07-what-is-the-difference-between-performance-testing-and-load-testing-video&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a two-for-one Ask a Flooder, I answer two questions: What is the difference between performance testing and load testing and in which situations is performance testing a better option than load testing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8CueAkDY5yE&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transcript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi again, it&amp;rsquo;s Nicole back for another Ask a Flooder. And this time, the question from one of our customers is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-the-difference-between-performance-testing-and-load-testing&#34;&gt;What is the difference between performance testing and load testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this is really a matter of semantics, and it kind of depends on whom you ask, but in general, performance is how quickly an application responds. So when you&amp;rsquo;re doing performance testing, you&amp;rsquo;re doing one of two things: there&amp;rsquo;s front-end performance, and then there&amp;rsquo;s back-end performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In front-end performance, you&amp;rsquo;re looking at things like how quickly does the application render for the customer on the client-side. It&amp;rsquo;s how fast something renders on the screen, so it&amp;rsquo;s how page resources can be rearranged or optimized so that the experience is a lot faster for the end customer. So the focus is on the client-side on the end user&amp;rsquo;s actual device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the back-end performance side, you&amp;rsquo;re looking at the server. How quickly does the server send a response to a request that&amp;rsquo;s sent by the browser?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So those are really two different things because back-end performance really looks at everything outside - everything beyond - the device of the customer. Both kinds of performance testing are important. A solid, holistic performance testing strategy will incorporate both front-end and back-end performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are different types of back-end performance testing. You might have heard of load testing, stress testing, volume testing. At Flood, we kind of refer to all of those under the bracket of load testing. They do have some semantic differences between them, but in general, we talk about load testing to refer to simulating traffic against an application server to see how that server responds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the type of the testing that you want to do will also affect the kind of performance testing tool that you choose. For instance, a tool like Flood Element can do both front-end and back-end testing, but a tool like JMeter is only going to be useful for the back-end performance testing. So you need to choose your test according to the testing type that you&amp;rsquo;d like to carry out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This customer also had a follow-up question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;in-which-situations-is-performance-testing-a-better-option-than-load-testing&#34;&gt;In which situations is performance testing a better option than load testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one answer to this is when front-end performance is required. So if what you&amp;rsquo;re after is trying to speed up how quickly your application renders on a mobile device, for instance, you might be better off looking at tools like GTMetrix or WebPageTest in order to measure and improve that side of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really want to stress here that neither front-end performance nor back-end performance is better than the other. If you&amp;rsquo;re asking me which type of testing you should do, my answer would be both. Till next time, happy flooding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-06-how-to-record-traffic-from-a-mobile-app-with-jmeter-video&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you record the traffic from your native mobile app using Apache JMeter? In this video, I explain step-by-step how to begin load testing a native mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/VVUyYF1VPlo&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might want to be doing this because you&amp;rsquo;re load testing a mobile app but either you don&amp;rsquo;t have access to your developers right now so they can&amp;rsquo;t help you with how the requests are made or what the requests are, or maybe you just want to verify what you&amp;rsquo;ve already been told. Either way, I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you how using my Android device (it&amp;rsquo;s a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+) and a Macbook Pro 13&amp;quot;. However, the same principles should apply to other mobile devices and laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-download-and-install-the-mobile-app&#34;&gt;Step 1: Download and install the mobile app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you&amp;rsquo;ll want to do is download and install the app. Now, if the app has already been released, then that&amp;rsquo;s no problem. You just go to the Google Play Store and download it. However, if it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been released yet and you&amp;rsquo;ve been given an APK file for the app, then you&amp;rsquo;ll have to tweak your settings a little bit in order to get your phone to allow you to download it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;m going to do this right with you. So go into Settings: pull down the little notification screen and hit the little gear icon, and you&amp;rsquo;ll see a bunch of settings there. Scroll down all the way to the bottom until you see About phone. Click that and then click Software Information. You&amp;rsquo;ll see the Build number halfway through the screen here&amp;ndash; and I know this is weird, but click on it seven times. You have to draw your pattern if you have one set up, but you&amp;rsquo;ll see here that it says Developer Mode has been enabled. That&amp;rsquo;s all you need to do; from now on you can install any APK, but be careful, because if you don&amp;rsquo;t trust the source, you know, they could do some damage to your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-2-set-up-the-https-test-script-recorder-on-jmeter&#34;&gt;Step 2: Set up the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder on JMeter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second step is setting up an HTTP recorder on JMeter. So let&amp;rsquo;s head over to our laptop. Make sure you&amp;rsquo;re connected to a wifi network. Now, this is a completely new JMeter test plan here. So just right-click on Test Plan and then hover over Add, and then you&amp;rsquo;re going to go down to Non-Test Elements. Select the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder. You&amp;rsquo;ll see here that the port it uses is 8888. We&amp;rsquo;ll need that for later. Now right-click on the Test Script Recorder, hit Add, and then Listener. We&amp;rsquo;ll add a View Results Tree to be able to capture the results that we need later. Now we&amp;rsquo;ll click on the Test Plan - right-click - and then we&amp;rsquo;re going to Add a Thread Group. Now let&amp;rsquo;s right-click on the Thread Group and go to Add &amp;gt; Logic Controller &amp;gt; Recording Controller. This is where the requests that we&amp;rsquo;re going to send are going to be recorded, and we&amp;rsquo;ll see both the requests and the responses in View Results Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-3-set-up-your-mobile-to-use-the-https-test-script-recorder-as-a-proxy&#34;&gt;Step 3: Set up your mobile to use the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder as a proxy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the third step is to set up your mobile to use a proxy. So, back on the mobile, go back to Settings and hit Connections. And then click on Wifi. Now verify that the wifi network that you&amp;rsquo;re connected to on your mobile is the same one as the wifi network that you&amp;rsquo;re connected to on your laptop. If it&amp;rsquo;s the same, click the gear icon. And then hit Advanced all the way at the bottom. Now the Proxy settings are on the second option here so hit the down menu here and then hit Manual. Now, for the Proxy host name we&amp;rsquo;ll have to go back to the computer to see what our local IP address is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in order to do that, you just have to go to System Preferences. I&amp;rsquo;m doing it from the Apple menu here and from System Preferences, click on Network. And once you&amp;rsquo;ve selected the wifi network, hit Advanced, and then TCP/IP. So what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for will be this IPv4 Address. Now you&amp;rsquo;re going to type that into the Host name field on your mobile. So let me just type that in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll note that this is actually a local IP address. It&amp;rsquo;s not your public IP address. Now for our proxy port, we&amp;rsquo;ll go and look at the laptop to see the Test Script Recorder Settings and it was 8888, so that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re going to put in here. All right. And then click on Save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-4-start-recording&#34;&gt;Step 4: Start recording&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 4 is recording the traffic. Now, go back to your laptop on JMeter and click on the Test Script Recorder. Now we&amp;rsquo;re going to click on Start. It&amp;rsquo;ll come up with this popup box here and you can just click OK since we already trust the source. You&amp;rsquo;ll see this little popup here to confirm that we are recording traffic. Now let&amp;rsquo;s see if we&amp;rsquo;ve actually configured it correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On our mobiles, let&amp;rsquo;s go back and open the app that you want to use. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to be using the IowaReporterApp. I just did an article on this on The New Stack (link in the description below) about how I would load test the Iowa Caucus Reporter App. So that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m going to be using for this tutorial as well. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to open that (&amp;ldquo;getting ready to caucus&amp;rdquo;) and I don&amp;rsquo;t have a valid precinct ID so I&amp;rsquo;m just going to put flood.io and I&amp;rsquo;m going to click Login. So it&amp;rsquo;s telling me that the connection isn&amp;rsquo;t private. I don&amp;rsquo;t actually expect this to work, because the app has been taken down and I don&amp;rsquo;t have valid login credentials, but I&amp;rsquo;m still just going to go forward. So, Proceed. You might have to do this as well if your certificates haven&amp;rsquo;t been set up correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so now we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten this error here and it says, &amp;ldquo;Oops, something went wrong&amp;rdquo;. So it&amp;rsquo;s handy to know what it looks like on your mobile so that you can go into JMeter and see if that&amp;rsquo;s what you see as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So on JMeter let&amp;rsquo;s go to the View Results Tree and it looks like Google Play tried to do a few things beforehand but what we&amp;rsquo;re really looking for is this IDP caucus thing. So, these are the requests that my phone made and these are the responses. So this is where we got the certificate error because it says &amp;ldquo;certificate unknown&amp;rdquo;. Now this is the actual request we sent for login. You can see the request here - the full request - and also the full response. Now, just to check we&amp;rsquo;ll make sure we got the same response in the body here on JMeter that we saw on our mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here it is; it says &amp;ldquo;Oops!, something went wrong&amp;rdquo;. You can of course just search for this. So we&amp;rsquo;ll stop the recording now because we&amp;rsquo;ve confirmed that we&amp;rsquo;ve gotten what we wanted. So in the recording controller, we can see the requests that were recorded from our mobile app and the first one looks like it was one to Google so that&amp;rsquo;s not one we want. If we were doing this again, we could actually go into the Test Script Recorder, go into this Requests Filtering tab, and we could just filter out or exclude the domains that we don&amp;rsquo;t want to test, like Google. But this looks like the request that we were actually looking for. You&amp;rsquo;ll see the full request here with all the parameters and the values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s how you record traffic from a native mobile app on JMeter. From here, you can then play around with the request. Like we saw, there were a lot of dynamic values that were recorded in the request. We would probably want to correlate those and make sure that we&amp;rsquo;re doing those correctly. But this is a really great starting point for testing a mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till the next Ask a Flooder, happy Flooding!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-05-how-do-i-get-started-with-flood-element-video&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/ask-a-flooder-05-how-do-i-get-started-with-flood-element-video&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this Ask a Flooder, I talk about getting started with Flood Element. Element is an open-source tool that is a good Selenium alternative for browser-based load testing. It runs Puppeteer under the hood to drive real browsers at scale and can be paired with Flood for cloud load testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWtnStKrh98&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TRANSCRIPT:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re sold on browser-based load testing and want to get started on Element, I think the easiest way to do that is by going to &lt;a href=&#34;http://element.flood.io&#34;&gt;element.flood.io&lt;/a&gt; and clicking on Install on the upper left corner. You can follow those instructions to get started, and you can also click on the links on the left side if you get stuck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Element is installed, open up the directory and look at the examples folder. There you&amp;rsquo;ll find a lot of sample scripts that we&amp;rsquo;ve already made up for you. The easiest way to get started is to just modify some of these slightly so that you&amp;rsquo;re testing your site. For example, you could just change the URL and step names to make it appropriate for what you&amp;rsquo;re testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you can run it locally using the command element run the name of your test script, like test.ts,  and then I also like to include the no-headless flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;element run test.ts --no-headless&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The no-headless flag is going to run a real browser, a Chromium browser, on your machine, so that you can see what the script is actually doing. This is a great way to debug and troubleshoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;re ready to run your load test on the cloud, you can simply drag and drop your Element script into the Flood stream editor and then start your load test as usual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the links in the description below for more information about Element, how to get started, and how to run an Element script on Flood.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ask a Flooder 04: Why would your load testing tool report higher response times than you expect?</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20200311-aaf04/</link>

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/why-would-your-load-testing-tool-report-higher-response-times-than-you-expect-video&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/why-would-your-load-testing-tool-report-higher-response-times-than-you-expect-video&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this Ask a Flooder, I tackle a question we get all the time from users regarding results, particularly for cloud load testing. Sometimes you might notice that response times that are reported in by your load testing tool do not match up with the response time you see from your own browser. What causes this, and how can we fix it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/goKK2aACZZY&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transcript:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s always confusing when your load testing tool reports higher average response times than what you can see while you&amp;rsquo;re manually accessing your application on your browser. There are many things that might cause this, but one of the most common causes for it is that you&amp;rsquo;re overloading your node generators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general rule of thumb, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to keep your CPU utilization at 80% or less throughout the duration of the test. It is normal for it to spike in the beginning, but it should ideally come to a more stable spot below 80%. If your node&amp;rsquo;s CPU utilization is going over 80% for most of the test, then what that means is that your node is struggling to get those requests out, which may lead to some inaccurate results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can confirm whether or not this is the cause of your high response times by checking the logs and checking the resource utilization on your nodes.If you&amp;rsquo;re running on Flood, you can do this while the flood is running by going over to Grids, selecting the grid, and then scrolling down on the panel on the right to see the CPU and memory as well as the network throughput.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of things you can do to fix this. The first one is to increase any sort of delays or think times in your script — and, if you don&amp;rsquo;t already have any, you should add some. Think times make the script a lot more realistic and a lot closer to what real users would do. If these values are too low, then your load testing tool is just going to run the script as fast as possible, consuming more resources than necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second thing you can do is reduce the number of users you&amp;rsquo;re running per node. This will free up more resources per node and make it a lot easier to scale up your load tests more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://guides.flood.io/results-analysis/troubleshooting-results-analysis/reported-response-times-higher-than-observed&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; for more detailed information on resource over-utilization and other possible reasons for differences between response times in a test and on a browser.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FOMO and performance testing: Why Robinhood went down</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20200309-fomo-and-performance-testing/</link>

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/fomo-and-performance-testing-why-robinhood-went-down&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/fomo-and-performance-testing-why-robinhood-went-down&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angry customers flocked to the internet when the Robinhood investment brokerage app went down last Monday and part of Tuesday, leaving them unable to trade stocks on a day where Wall Street reported historic gains. Could this have been prevented?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is yes. Applications should always be assessed for risk and tested accordingly. Risk-based load testing helps unearth problems that would otherwise only surface in production. Testing applications end-to-end as a system instead of just as a collection of isolated components allows us to build software that is more resilient. The problem is that this type of testing can be difficult to carry out. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll go through the entire process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-robinhood&#34;&gt;What is Robinhood?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robinhood is an app I&amp;rsquo;ve personally had my eye on since it opened a waiting list about five years ago for Australians wanting to see the American company come to our shores. It &lt;a href=&#34;https://australianfintech.com.au/local-start-stake-beats-us-giant-robinhood-bring-australians-free-share-trading/&#34;&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t look like it&amp;rsquo;s happening&lt;/a&gt; now, but if that waiting list still exists, I&amp;rsquo;m on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robinhood is a brokerage app that takes inspiration from the legend it was named after to &amp;ldquo;give to the poor,&amp;rdquo; bring zero-commission trading to its customers. Instead of earning from commissions, Robinhood makes its money from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/020515/how-robinhood-makes-money.asp&#34;&gt;a variety of other methods&lt;/a&gt;, including premium platform fees, interest on customers&#39; uninvested capital, and payments received in exchange for coursing customers&#39; orders through third-party market-makers. It&amp;rsquo;s an enticing premise, and one that the company has used in conjunction with mobile apps to appeal to millennials and technophiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200309-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: From &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinhood.com/us/en/&#34;&gt;Robinhood&amp;rsquo;s homepage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-caused-the-robinhood-app-to-fail&#34;&gt;What caused the Robinhood app to fail?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, its wild success with the tech-savvy crowd also meant that when it went down last Monday morning in the US, its customers took to the internet in droves to draw attention to the failure. In a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2020/3/3/an-update-from-robinhoods-founders&#34;&gt;blog post from Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;, the company&amp;rsquo;s co-founders, Baiju Bhatt and Vladimir Tenev, admitted that the outage was due to &amp;ldquo;stress on [their] infrastructure— which struggled with unprecedented load.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outages you have experienced over the last two days are not acceptable and we want to share an update on the current situation. Our team has spent the last two days evaluating and addressing this issue. We worked as quickly as possible to restore service, but it took us a while. Too long. - &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2020/3/3/an-update-from-robinhoods-founders&#34;&gt;Baiju Bhatt and Bladimir Tenev&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhatt and Tenev went on to explain that the load on their servers had caused a &amp;ldquo;thundering herd&amp;rdquo; effect. This effect describes a situation in which a backend server receives a large number of concurrent requests and, instead of different threads processing these requests simultaneously, all threads attempt to process the same request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever played four-player Overcooked, it&amp;rsquo;s like having everyone sprint to a fire extinguisher to try to put out a fire from overcooked pasta, but instead, the constant button mashing means you just pass the extinguisher around and yell at each other while the fire rages on. Before you know it, the entire kitchen is on fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200309-02.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: From &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/csac0425/status/963053160259510277&#34;&gt;Twitter user @csac0425&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the technical cause of the outage was an infrastructure problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I think the REAL cause was FOMO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-fomo&#34;&gt;What is FOMO?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOMO is the Fear Of Missing Out, and it&amp;rsquo;s a phenomenon that&amp;rsquo;s been particularly exacerbated by social media. Instead of only hearing news from people you interact with in the physical world, it just takes a few seconds to open up Twitter on your smartphone and see what thousands of people are talking about. Twitter will even helpfully tell you what&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;trending&amp;rdquo; in your country, and other social networks also employ algorithms to determine what messages to show you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-fomo-affect-application-performance&#34;&gt;How does FOMO affect application performance?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can see FOMO in how people have reacted to the coronavirus COVID-19. Despite pleas to leave masks for medical professionals at real risk, people have bought out the stock for these masks despite living in countries with little to no sign of the coronavirus. In Sydney, Australia, residents are stockpiling toilet paper (of all things) in large quantities, clearing out shelves from supermarkets, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-51731422&#34;&gt;getting into knife fights over toilet paper&lt;/a&gt; due to their panic at the thought of doing without.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This photo of an empty toilet paper aisle was taken by our Principal Engineer, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lachie&#34;&gt;Lachie Cox&lt;/a&gt;, in a supermarket in Sydney last week.&lt;/em&gt;
‍
FOMO of this magnitude ultimately also manifests itself in the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which represents the performance of the top 30 largest companies in the US, dropped by 3,500 points last week amidst fears that the coronavirus would stall production in countries most affected by COVID-19, leading to lower returns across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, an abrupt about-face. The Dow went from recording its &lt;a href=&#34;https://nypost.com/2020/03/09/dow-loses-over-2000-points-worst-single-day-drop-ever-as-oil-prices-crash/&#34;&gt;biggest &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; loss in a single day on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; to posting a record gain of 1,200 points on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guess who gets to adjust to all this volatility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robinhood&amp;rsquo;s founders reported that the &amp;ldquo;highly volatile and historic market conditions; record volume; and record sign-ups&amp;rdquo; contributed to the infrastructure issues they faced. We can only imagine just how many users they saw on their systems during this period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOMO creates mass hysteria and panic, both of which cause customers to behave irrationally and likely very differently than previously recorded. So how do you create a workload model that accounts for this volatility? How do you tailor your load tests for FOMO? I&amp;rsquo;ll run you through the process, using Robinhood as an example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;does-your-application-require-fomo-load-testing&#34;&gt;Does your application require FOMO load testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All testing should be risk-based. Start with why: why should you test an application component? Why does your application require this kind of testing or that one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Robinhood&amp;rsquo;s case, there were a few indicators that pointed to the necessity of FOMO testing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A customer base made up of a younger, tech-savvy generation&lt;/strong&gt;. ‍This demographic is very likely to take to social media with complaints, making negative publicity a real risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complexity&lt;/strong&gt;. ‍Robinhood&amp;rsquo;s systems must receive customers&#39; orders, forward and place those orders to market makers, and display real-time market data. Robinhood customers can also purchase options on stocks as well as cryptocurrency, further increasing the complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial component&lt;/strong&gt;. ‍Anything that involves taking people&amp;rsquo;s money should have a high priority for any testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to your money, we know how important it is for you to have answers. - &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2020/3/3/an-update-from-robinhoods-founders&#34;&gt;Baiju Bhatt and Bladimir Tenev&lt;/a&gt;, co-founders of Robinhood&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Record-breaking growth&lt;/strong&gt;. ‍Robinhood had 1 million users in 2016, 6 million in 2018, and 10 million last December, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/04/start-up-robinhood-tops-10-million-accounts-even-as-industry-follows-in-free-trading-footsteps.html&#34;&gt;according to CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. Exponential growth brings some major growing pains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry history of expensive failures&lt;/strong&gt;. ‍&lt;a href=&#34;https://qz.com/1812086/robinhood-brokerage-app-suffers-second-day-of-outages/&#34;&gt;Quartz points out&lt;/a&gt; that software or infrastructure failures have cost the financial industry millions in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recent legal action&lt;/strong&gt;. The regulatory body FINRA &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/19/investing/robinhood-trading-app-fine-finra/index.html&#34;&gt;fined Robinhood&lt;/a&gt; US$1.25 million just last December for placing orders for customers without looking for the lowest price. While this isn&amp;rsquo;t a huge fine for a company that was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-22/robinhood-is-worth-7-6-billion-after-new-funding-round&#34;&gt;valued at US$7.6 billion last July&lt;/a&gt;, any legal action should make a company tread more carefully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are solid reasons to warrant load testing Robinhood&amp;rsquo;s systems beyond just &amp;ldquo;expected&amp;rdquo; load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planning-for-fomo&#34;&gt;Planning for FOMO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve determined that your application is susceptible to FOMO, the next thing to do is plan how to structure your load tests to include its effect in your test runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-type-of-app-is-it&#34;&gt;What type of app is it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robinhood consists of three apps: two for mobile (iOS and Android) and one for the web. It is currently only available to US residents, which means that getting mobile apps downloaded is problematic as it would entail changing countries in the app stores to get access. Since I live in the Netherlands and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to do that, I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on the web app specifically when scripting the load test, and I&amp;rsquo;ll assume that the same underlying application servers service both web and mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;workload-modeling&#34;&gt;Workload modeling&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;business-processes-to-test&#34;&gt;Business processes to test&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that the app went down on a day where markets were &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt;, we can assume that most of the people on Robinhood&amp;rsquo;s apps were doing one of two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signing up&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying shares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should ideally test both, but let&amp;rsquo;s focus on signups here because it&amp;rsquo;s easier to test without access to the actual app (which requires a US social security number).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;number-of-virtual-users-at-peak-load&#34;&gt;Number of virtual users at peak load&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s try to come up with a number of users that we can use as Robinhood&amp;rsquo;s peak hourly load. This task would be easier if Robinhood shared their analytics, but we can still make some educated guesses with what &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; been made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200309-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Image from &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.apptopia.com/robinhood-now-has-more-mobile-monthly-active-users-than-the-top-legacy-providers-combined&#34;&gt;Apptopia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.apptopia.com/robinhood-now-has-more-mobile-monthly-active-users-than-the-top-legacy-providers-combined&#34;&gt;According to Apptopia&lt;/a&gt;, Robinhood&amp;rsquo;s highest number of mobile installations was in 2018, when it saw 2 million downloads of its mobile app in a quarter. This period coincides with when Robinhood released cryptocurrency trading support, which looks like increased signups—in the third quarter of 2019, this figure was about 1.5 million. 2 million quarterly downloads translates to about 666,666 downloads per month. Let&amp;rsquo;s call that 700,000 and take this number of mobile downloads as a starting figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock market is only open on the weekdays, so we can divide 700,000 signups a month by 20 days, and we get 35,000 signups a day. The markets are also only open for about 7 hours a day, but the load probably isn&amp;rsquo;t evenly spread out across the 7 hours— I would expect that people would have more time during lunch to sign up for Robinhood. So let&amp;rsquo;s say that the majority of those signups would happen within three hours (from 11 am to 2 pm, for example). By dividing 35,000 signups per day by 3 hours, we get about 11,667 users per hour. Let&amp;rsquo;s round that up to 12,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we translate this to the number of virtual users we need to run? Let&amp;rsquo;s think about how long each user stays on the app. The signup process does require approval, so that&amp;rsquo;s a hard stop— new users won&amp;rsquo;t be able to sign up and then start trading immediately afterwards. &lt;a href=&#34;https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/360001213123/open-my-account/&#34;&gt;This approval could take up to a day&lt;/a&gt;, or up to seven days if documents are required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at the application form itself, we can see it is relatively standard and requires only information that most people are likely to have handy (social security number and contact details). I timed how long it took me to go through the part of it I could access, and I estimated that 10 minutes would be sufficient time to go through all the tabs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200309-05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://signup.robinhood.com/?&#34;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want to spread out users evenly across the hour— that is, we don&amp;rsquo;t want 12,000 users to sign up and leave, all within 10 minutes. We want equal portions of those users to be signing up throughout the entire hour. Dividing 12,000 by 6 (the number of 10-minute intervals in an hour), we get 2,000. 2,000 is the number of threads we need active at any one point of time. Each of those threads signs up one user for 10 minutes, then signs up 5 more users until the hour is up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have our figure: we need 2,000 &lt;em&gt;virtual&lt;/em&gt; users per hour to simulate 12,000 signups in an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;test-scenarios&#34;&gt;Test scenarios&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to running the standard battery of load tests, testing for FOMO requires exploring the upper limits of the application. Assuming the peak load testing goes well, we can use the 2,000 virtual users per hour figure from our peak load calculations as a starting point for these more destructive tests. To this end, here are some test scenarios I&amp;rsquo;d consider running if I were testing the Robinhood app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soak testing&lt;/strong&gt;. ‍Soak testing means running typically a little less than the peak load profile, but over a longer amount of time. In Robinhood&amp;rsquo;s case, perhaps we could run 1,000 virtual users for 8 hours. We would expect that the response times reported during this test would be the same; otherwise, there is likely a performance bottleneck, such as a memory leak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stress testing&lt;/strong&gt;. ‍Stress testing means increasing the number of users on an application at regular increments until the application crashes. We can start with 2,000 virtual users per hour, and then add 500 users every 30 minutes to see how the application handles it. This test helps determine how much room there is for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200309-06.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Stepped load profile for stress testing, generated in JMeter&lt;/em&gt;
‍&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resilience testing&lt;/strong&gt;. ‍Resilience testing involves running the peak load test and then simulating an outage by turning off key components to see how the application behaves. If two servers share the load, for instance, we could turn one off and check to make sure that the user sessions on the terminated node are moved over onto the remaining node. This test shows whether the application recovers gracefully from an unforeseen event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these tests help us prepare for the unexpected, and they might have identified the &amp;ldquo;thundering herd&amp;rdquo; problem that contributed to Robinhood&amp;rsquo;s outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scripting-for-fomo&#34;&gt;Scripting for FOMO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tool-selection&#34;&gt;Tool selection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test mobile as well as web apps, I would typically use a protocol-level load testing tool like JMeter to simulate the load. However, &lt;a href=&#34;https://thenewstack.io/how-id-load-test-the-iowa-caucus-app/&#34;&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve already done that&lt;/a&gt;. I also noticed that Robinhood makes use of some dynamic parameters, such as a csrf token:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200309-07.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Chrome Developer Tools on &lt;a href=&#34;https://signup.robinhood.com/?&#34;&gt;Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
‍
We can usually find the value of this token in the response of the previous page. It is a security feature to allow Robinhood to verify that the same users make all requests in the same session. Tokens can be scripted around in a tool like JMeter, but it can be time-consuming. So for this article, I decided to show another tool that makes this problem go away. I used &lt;a href=&#34;https://element.flood.io/&#34;&gt;Flood Element&lt;/a&gt;, which is an open-source tool we created based on Puppeteer. One of its advantages is that it runs on the browser level. Instead of diving into HTTP requests and tokens, I just told Element which buttons to click.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted a script that would do the following things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Navigate to Robinhood&amp;rsquo;s home page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on &amp;ldquo;Sign Up&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click on the &amp;ldquo;Get Your Free Stock&amp;rdquo; button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fill out the signup form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I stopped short of actually submitting the form because I don&amp;rsquo;t want to create dummy accounts on Robinhood&amp;rsquo;s database— I just want to show how this flow can be scripted with Element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help me identify the elements on the page that I wanted the script to interact with, I used Chrome&amp;rsquo;s built-in Developer Tools. Specifically, I used the Inspect Element button (in orange below) to click on a field and find where it was in the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200309-08.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, to find out how to identify the email field, I right-clicked on the code on the right, hovered over Copy, and then clicked Copy selector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200309-09.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gave me the value &lt;code&gt;#signup_email_field&lt;/code&gt;, which I then used in the script like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;//Type Email address
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;await&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;browser&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;By&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;signup_email_field&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;),&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;nicole@flood.io&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the script that I ended up with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;step&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;TestSettings&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Until&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;By&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;MouseButtons&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Device&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Driver&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;ENV&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;@flood/element&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

	})
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In every step, I also added a &lt;code&gt;takeScreenshot()&lt;/code&gt; , which is one of my very favorite features of Element. It&amp;rsquo;s so useful to be able to save these screenshots and use them to determine exactly what&amp;rsquo;s happening in the script. Here&amp;rsquo;s what it looks like running my Element script locally. The automated browser is on the left, and my terminal (iTerm) is on the right, running Element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200309-10.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;running-a-fomo-test&#34;&gt;Running a FOMO test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we&amp;rsquo;ve got a script that runs locally. How do we run it at scale? Additionally, Robinhood won&amp;rsquo;t allow users outside the US to sign up. How do we make sure that our virtual users are allowed to sign up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is a load testing platform like &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/&#34;&gt;Flood&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Flood, running our script is a matter of uploading the script and selecting some options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200309-11.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Flood test design interface&lt;/em&gt;
‍
Flood also lets us choose which regions to generate load from. Below I&amp;rsquo;ve got it set up to run for an hour from four different US cities, with each one starting 500 users. This configuration gives us our 2,000 virtual user figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200309-12.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this peak load test goes well, we could then go on to run the other test scenarios that we described earlier. Each one puts pressure on application servers in different ways, identifying performance bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;results-and-reruns&#34;&gt;Results and reruns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Robinhood is a live application, I didn&amp;rsquo;t run the test— it&amp;rsquo;s never a good idea to load test a domain you don&amp;rsquo;t own when you&amp;rsquo;re talking about thousands of users. However, &lt;a href=&#34;https://api.flood.io/pfQuAGz3&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s a shareable link&lt;/a&gt; to another small Element test I ran previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real-time dashboards like that one on Flood allow you to get a quick look into how the load test is running and to make any changes if necessary. When testing for FOMO, I think they&amp;rsquo;re invaluable. For example, during a stress test where users are added at regular intervals, a real-time dashboard would help you identify increases in response time as a result of the increased number of users. It would also let you monitor the test and stop it when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the link above, click on the right arrow on the lone transaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200309-13.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will take you to the Transaction Detail page. Remember those screenshots from Element? If you have any in your script, you&amp;rsquo;ll see them here, arranged according to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200309-14.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lets you troubleshoot issues during FOMO testing and react quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with sound load testing strategies in place, it&amp;rsquo;s challenging to plan for the massive spike in traffic that FOMO can bring, yet it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to do so. FOMO, as a phenomenon, is only going to increase in magnitude as social networks make it easier to spread fear, uncertainty, and doubt as well as information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may not be able to determine precisely what will break, or when, but what we can do is put systems into place to plan for it. We can assess an application&amp;rsquo;s susceptibility to FOMO and plan for end-to-end performance engineering of the system as a whole. We can start with the assumption that applications will fail and then determine the most likely candidates for that failure. We can routinely expose systems to traffic and circumstances that are extraordinary, and in doing so, we can improve our preparedness for something like FOMO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FOMO is irrational and unpredictable— but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean it needs to be unexpected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/load-testing-lessons-from-the-iowa-caucus&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/load-testing-lessons-from-the-iowa-caucus&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://thenewstack.io/how-id-load-test-the-iowa-caucus-app/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR? Here are the highlights in this article:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadow, Inc. created a mobile app for the Iowa Caucus in February 2020, and the app failed, causing reported results to be delayed.
The app reported different vote totals due to a system integration bug where the output was in a different format than what it needed to be.
Here are the steps to load testing a mobile app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test planning: Does the app require load testing? If yes, what is the underlying technology? How do we create a workload model?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scripting: Which mobile load testing tool should we use? How do we record traffic from a mobile device?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execution: What load test scenarios should we have? How can we scale up the load generated?
Conclusion: While the Iowa Reported App failure was not due entirely to load testing, load testing could have helped make it more robust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A company called Shadow, Inc. made headlines earlier this week when they developed an app to count and report votes during the Iowa Democratic Caucus in the US. This app, called IowaReporterApp, ended up failing on several fronts, resulting in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/upshot/iowa-caucuses-errors-results.html&#34;&gt;days-long delay&lt;/a&gt; in publishing the total votes, during which manual methods had to be employed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200306-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ShadowIncHQ/status/1224773796307050497&#34;&gt;@ShadowIncHQ on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This delay led to significant criticism from the software testing industry as well as from the general public. Some developers raised questions about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3a8ajj/an-off-the-shelf-skeleton-project-experts-analyze-the-app-that-broke-iowa&#34;&gt;code quality of the app&lt;/a&gt;. The app &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/iowademocrats/status/1225170253778444291&#34;&gt;inaccurately reported voting totals&lt;/a&gt; that differed from the Democratic Party&amp;rsquo;s own manual reports, suggesting an issue with functional testing, particularly system integration testing. Shadow&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/481409-dhs-chief-says-offer-to-vet-iowa-caucus-app-was-declined&#34;&gt;refusal to accept the Department of Homeland Security&amp;rsquo;s help with security testing&lt;/a&gt; also raised eyebrows. What was perhaps the most damning, though, was the question of &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/zeynep/status/1224545350364672001&#34;&gt;whether such an app was necessary in the first place&lt;/a&gt;, when cheaper and more effective solutions existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m most interested in, however, are the load issues that the app faced. Let&amp;rsquo;s rewind a little to before the caucus. How would I have load tested an app like the IowaReporterApp?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planning-a-mobile-load-testing&#34;&gt;Planning a mobile load testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first things to figure out when planning a load test is whether a load test is even necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;do-you-even-need-to-load-test-your-mobile-app&#34;&gt;Do you even need to load test your mobile app?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To answer that, I had to find out more about the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the caucus, residents of Iowa who registered themselves as Democratic voters gathered to vote on whom they thought should be the party&amp;rsquo;s candidate for the presidential elections later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few things that I think make this app the perfect candidate for load testing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was highly publicized.&lt;/strong&gt; The caucuses would always have been an event of international interest, but the hype surrounding electronic voting increased media attention on the caucus even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was mission-critical&lt;/strong&gt;. The precinct chairs would use the app as the primary device for capturing votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It needed to handle significant simultaneous load&lt;/strong&gt;. There were &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Iowa_Democratic_caucuses&#34;&gt;over a thousand precinct caucuses&lt;/a&gt; organized, each with a precinct chair that would be using the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, the answer is a resounding &amp;ldquo;Yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-type-of-app-is-it&#34;&gt;What type of app is it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best way to learn about an app is to ask its developers. In this case, I opted to do a little research on my own by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z3b3g9/here-is-a-link-to-the-shadow-inc-app-that-blew-up-the-iowa-caucus&#34;&gt;downloading the .apk file that Motherboard (Vice) made available&lt;/a&gt; and looking through the code myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app is a mobile-only app for Android and iOS devices, written mostly using Facebook&amp;rsquo;s React Native package. The primary function of the app was to sent the vote totals to Shadow Inc.&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/functions/?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=emea-nl-all-en-dr-bkws-all-all-trial-e-gcp-1008073&amp;amp;utm_content=text-ad-none-any-DEV_c-CRE_253510459861-ADGP_Hybrid+%7C+AW+SEM+%7C+BKWS+~+EXA_M:1_NL_EN_General_Cloud+Functions_ETL+Warehouse-KWID_43700019207359819-kwd-135583196912-userloc_9065312&amp;amp;utm_term=KW_google%20functions-ST_google+functions&amp;amp;ds_rl=1242853&amp;amp;ds_rl=1245734&amp;amp;ds_rl=1245734&amp;amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6bKKzNi_5wIVk-R3Ch04HA1XEAAYASAAEgKTcPD_BwE&#34;&gt;Google Cloud Functions&lt;/a&gt; server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology involved is worth noting because it can help determine which load testing tool to use. Since the Iowa Reporter App, like most mobile apps, sends requests to a RESTful API, JMeter or Gatling, both well-tested, robust, and open-source protocol-level tools with large user bases, were perfect for the job. I decided to go with JMeter, my personal tool of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-do-we-create-a-workload-model&#34;&gt;How do we create a workload model?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the workload model, which is a plan for how the load we generate needs to look. The objective here is to simulate the load that matches the expected real-life load as closely as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point, I would typically look at historical data to try to see the amount of load and the load profile. If I had metrics on the server traffic after previous releases of the app using something like Google Analytics or an APM tool, I would have used that data as a starting point for the workload model of this release. However, in this case, the app hadn&amp;rsquo;t been publicly released before, so I needed to make some educated guesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Iowa_Democratic_caucuses&#34;&gt;According to Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;, there were a total of 1,777 Iowa precinct caucuses, of which 99 were global satellite caucuses set up for Iowa residents temporarily not able to attend the local caucuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Democratic caucus, the actual voting process generally takes &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/03/iowa-caucuses-2020-elections-candidates&#34;&gt;about two hours&lt;/a&gt;. In the Iowa caucus, the precinct chairs would have used the app twice - once for each round of voting. Around the end of the two hours, each chair&amp;rsquo;s app would have sent the main payload, containing total votes for each candidate, to the backend server. All this is done simultaneously across all 1,777 precincts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, there are two main events here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The login - Precinct chairs needed to log in to the app, which would presumably have happened around the same time across all precincts towards the beginning of the voting process, because the app also contained instructions on how to run a caucus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The submission - This is the transmission of the total vote counts for each candidate, sent to Google Cloud Functions, and would also have happened around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s possible that the app also sent other requests between these two events, but since most of the app is inaccessible without a valid login, I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on the initial login request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a situation like this where I don&amp;rsquo;t have previous data to show how spread out those requests was, it&amp;rsquo;s prudent to err on the side of caution. Assuming the precinct chairs triggered those requests within 10 minutes of each other and rounding up the number of requests for some wiggle room, I estimated that there would have been 1,800 login requests within 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to test this as a gradual ramp-up of users within 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scripting-for-mobile&#34;&gt;Scripting for mobile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, time to write the script. Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the luxury of being able to ask the developers for the format of the login request, I did the next best thing and tried to find out myself by recording the app traffic in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200306-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;recording-mobile-traffic-on-a-laptop-with-jmeter&#34;&gt;Recording mobile traffic on a laptop with JMeter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how I was able to see the request from the mobile app:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I downloaded the app to a spare Android mobile by using the APK link above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up an HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder on JMeter on my laptop with the port 8888.  I also made sure my laptop was connected to my wifi network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set up my mobile to use a proxy using my laptop&amp;rsquo;s local IP address on the network and port 8888.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I went back to JMeter on my laptop and started the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I navigated to the app, typed in flood.io in the Precinct ID field (obviously not a real ID), and clicked the &amp;ldquo;Click here to log in&amp;rdquo; button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the traffic as seen on JMeter&amp;rsquo;s View Results Tree listener afterward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200306-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s the recorded request within the recording controller:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200306-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;analyzing-the-request&#34;&gt;Analyzing the request&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like at least the initial login request is a GET to an Auth0 service, with several parameters being passed in the body. It also has some authorization headers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parameter values also look like they might be dynamic, meaning they change from session to session. At this point, I would typically change some of these from being hardcoded values into dynamic ones so that the application receives a request in the right format, and I could look through &lt;a href=&#34;https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication&#34;&gt;Auth0&amp;rsquo;s API documentation&lt;/a&gt; to find out how the authentication message should be formulated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I don&amp;rsquo;t have a valid login for testing purposes, I skipped this step and just used the raw request for demonstration purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;preparing-to-run&#34;&gt;Preparing to run&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think time is a delay between requests meant to simulate the time it takes for a user to think before taking another action. Without think time, JMeter would fire off requests one after another, which often isn&amp;rsquo;t realistic and drains resources. I don&amp;rsquo;t want that, so I added a JMeter timer. There are plenty of timers available, but I settled on a Uniform Random Timer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/3a8ajj/an-off-the-shelf-skeleton-project-experts-analyze-the-app-that-broke-iowa&#34;&gt;The CEO of Shadow told Motherboard&lt;/a&gt; that many precinct chairs were confused by the login process as they had to put in three strings of numbers in the right sequence. So, I decided to work that into the script with the timer. I set it up with a constant delay of 2 minutes and a random delay of 1 minute so that the delay would vary from 2 minutes to 3 minutes to simulate a precinct chair attempting to log in a few times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;execution-running-your-mobile-load-test&#34;&gt;Execution: Running your mobile load test&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/z3b3g9/here-is-a-link-to-the-shadow-inc-app-that-blew-up-the-iowa-caucus&#34;&gt;According to Motherboard&lt;/a&gt;, Shadow has already taken the app servers offline. However, it&amp;rsquo;s not a good idea to run a full load test against an endpoint that you don&amp;rsquo;t own, so I decided not to run a test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, though, I’d want to start with a shakeout test of 10 users or so, and then gradually increase the user load until the peak of 1,800 users. I also would have played around with changing the load profile, such as by increasing or decreasing the ramp-up or steady-state durations, experimenting with stress tests and soak tests, and adding traffic from another availability zone to simulate the 99 satellite precincts around the world. Running multiple load generators can quickly get out of hand if you want to use physical machines, so I would run load tests on the cloud with something like &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/&#34;&gt;Flood&lt;/a&gt;. All of these little changes would have given valuable data that would help me gauge the app’s performance in production-like situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building quality software is not a trivial task. There are many moving parts to account for, and critical errors can be introduced in every stage of an app&amp;rsquo;s development. While load issues were not the main culprit in the failure of the IowaReporterApp, a simple load test like the one I describe here, might have improved app stability and reliability. Even in cases where load testing doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem necessary, it can still uncover gross issues in configuration, usability, or security for an app developed on a deadline.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How AirTasker uses Ruby JMeter and Flood for their load testing</title>

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/how-airtasker-uses-ruby-jmeter-and-flood-for-their-load-testing&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/how-airtasker-uses-ruby-jmeter-and-flood-for-their-load-testing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the recent RubyConf 2020 held in Melbourne, Australia, Nancy Cai from AirTasker talked about how they built a performance testing framework using Ruby JMeter and Flood. Luckily, we had some pleasantly surprised Flooders in attendance to take notes during this fantastic talk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AirTasker is a platform allowing the outsourcing of everyday tasks. When discussing the reasons that AirTasker decided they wanted to carry out performance and load testing, Nancy told a fascinating story about an overly successful marketing campaign—a good problem to have, but a problem nonetheless. The Sydney Cats and Dogs Home, an animal shelter, teamed up with AirTasker to pay one lucky person $500 to spend the day playing with the resident animals. The prospect of this dream job created an enormous surge in AirTasker&amp;rsquo;s traffic that caused alarm bells to go off on the underlying application servers, resulting in an end-user experience that was less than desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nancy included this hilarious slide about some common feelings regarding application performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200224-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;A common feeling when application performance is brought up&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;steps-for-running-a-performance-test-the-airtasker-way&#34;&gt;Steps for running a performance test, the AirTasker way&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To avoid repeating that mistake, Nancy and her team set out to run performance testing by using the following simple steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Determine performance criteria.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Configure the test environment to be as production-like as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plan and design based on user behavior, including preparing test data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement test design and set up the framework (which in AirTasker&amp;rsquo;s case involved Ruby JMeter as the performance testing tool and Flood as a load testing solution).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyze and fine-tune results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;setting-up-a-load-testing-tool-and-framework&#34;&gt;Setting up a load testing tool and framework&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came to selecting the right tools for the job, AirTasker wanted tools that met the following criteria:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to simulate production-like traffic easily&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Widespread use in the industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ease of creation and maintenance of tests for everyone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Historical results aggregation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualization of performance metrics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integration with CI and monitoring tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nancy&amp;rsquo;s team compared several load testing tools and found they enjoyed using the Apache JMeter tool, which is a popular open source load testing software. However, they quickly ran into an &amp;ldquo;out of memory&amp;rdquo; error after attempting to run about 400-800 concurrent users on a single machine. She and her team decided to use a distributed load testing platform to run the load they required to scale up more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-airtasker-chose-flood&#34;&gt;Why AirTasker chose Flood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200224-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;JMeter, Flood, and the Ruby JMeter gem combination is a winner&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also chose Flood.io [&amp;hellip;] because it comes in with a really good open-source gem called Ruby JMeter. It is a Ruby-based DSL for building JMeter test plans. - Nancy Cai, AirTasker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nancy and her team enjoyed the benefits of being able to write load tests natively in Ruby and then using Flood&amp;rsquo;s Ruby JMeter gem, which is a Domain-Specific Language (DSL). Flood allowed them to turn their Ruby scripts into .jmx files, which is the native XML format that JMeter uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they were ready to scale up, AirTasker ran the same JMeter script in Flood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200224-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Sample of a report on Flood from a JMeter test&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real-time Flood dashboard allowed them to see that there was a problem on one of the API endpoints, called &amp;ldquo;Get pet reviews.&amp;rdquo; Further investigations revealed a performance issue due to a long-running query against a database server in the code, which AirTasker&amp;rsquo;s developers could fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;best-practices&#34;&gt;Best practices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nancy gives some great advice for anyone running a performance test, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;asking the right questions as a load tester&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;running baseline tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;being aware of the difference between your test and production environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;keeping in mind the caching and autoscaling mechanisms that may drastically change the results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the differences between stress testing and other types of performance testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were so thrilled to hear Nancy&amp;rsquo;s story on how Flood helped AirTasker run their performance tests. Catch the entirety of Nancy&amp;rsquo;s talk below, and check out the resource links at the end of the post to follow Nancy&amp;rsquo;s story.‍&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/mobile-load-testing-on-the-cloud&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/mobile-load-testing-on-the-cloud&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-mobile-load-testing&#34;&gt;What is mobile load testing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is the difference between load testing web apps and mobile apps? In general, your goal is the same: to improve app performance by systematically exposing your app to the load you expect, whether it&amp;rsquo;s on the web or on a mobile device. However, while the purpose may be the same, there a few extra things to consider when it comes to mobile app performance, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to make some key mistakes. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll give you a little bit of the theory behind mobile load testing and then show you practical steps to script and execute a load test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenges-in-mobile-load-testing&#34;&gt;Challenges in mobile load testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a web app that is mobile first, and your users typically access your site through a browser on their mobile devices as well as on their laptops, you have more choices for optimizing mobile performance. You can use browser-based load testing tools as well as protocol-level load testing tools to generate load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a native mobile app that you&amp;rsquo;d like to load test, though, browser-based load testing tools are a little more complicated. One of the most common approaches to mobile load testing is to use some type of device farm. A device farm is a collection of mobile devices and a way to orchestrate and control them so that they access an application simultaneously. Here&amp;rsquo;s why they&amp;rsquo;re not the best choice for load testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200221-01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Fragmentation can make mobile load testing difficult&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;device-fragmentation&#34;&gt;Device fragmentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges is mobile device fragmentation. Not only are there a lot of mobile devices, but there are also many operating systems and versions. Even narrowing the pool to Android and ios leaves us with a large selection. A common mistake in mobile load testing is trying to account for these hundreds of combinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;logistics&#34;&gt;Logistics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another challenge is the logistics of controlling physical devices with different operating systems, which is not trivial. Unless you have a thousand friends that you can rope into doing this at the same time, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to pay for some sort of service that can orchestrate this for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cost&#34;&gt;Cost&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also the fact that this process is resource-intensive. Even if your device farm consists of emulators on virtual machines rather than physical mobile devices, that still uses up a lot of CPU and memory, and you&amp;rsquo;d need to spin up dozens or hundreds of machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, this type of mobile load testing is not the only option available to us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;better-strategies-for-mobile-load-testing&#34;&gt;Better strategies for mobile load testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A better option for back-end performance testing or load testing your mobile application is by using API load testing, which works on the protocol level. To understand this, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what aspects of software we are analyzing when we test for &amp;ldquo;performance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can generally break up performance testing into two types: front-end and back-end. Both types have the goal of making the app respond faster to end-users, but they do so by optimizing different parts of the application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;front-end-performance&#34;&gt;Front-end performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Front-end performance is primarily concerned with the UI of the app. A front-end performance tester optimizes page resources (like CSS, images, JS) to render faster on the page. Since a mobile app runs on a user&amp;rsquo;s smartphone or another mobile device, its front-end performance would also be affected by things we can&amp;rsquo;t control, such as the operating system and version of the mobile or its physical configuration (CPU and memory). A front-end issue for a particular mobile device type might not necessarily affect performance on another. Device farms can be good at measuring front-end performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;back-end-performance&#34;&gt;Back-end performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, back-end performance focuses on the underlying mobile application servers. A back-end performance tester optimizes the things behind the interface, and it is affected by things like the size of the responses that a server sends to a user, server configuration, application infrastructure, and how downstream servers talk to each other. These factors may be invisible to a typical end-user. A performance bottleneck in the back-end is likely to affect all users of an app to some degree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;load-testing-for-back-end-performance&#34;&gt;Load testing for back-end performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing is about determining how your mobile application behaves in response to traffic, so it targets the back-end components of the application, not the front-end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both front-end and back-end performance are necessary to get a holistic view of mobile performance. Still, &lt;strong&gt;if you want to load test your mobile app, you need to generate traffic on your application &lt;em&gt;server&lt;/em&gt;, and not necessarily to drive the app on real devices&lt;/strong&gt;. Understanding this opens up options for mobile load testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200221-02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A data center can be out of most testing teams&#39; reach&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;api-load-testing&#34;&gt;API load testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most native mobile apps work by using a RESTful API to send instructions to the application server. Luckily for us, there&amp;rsquo;s no magic in sending these types of requests from a smartphone— we can simulate this easily by using an API load testing tool to send these requests on a non-mobile device too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some advantages of using API load testing tools to test your mobile app instead of using a device farm:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easier to set up and maintain&lt;/strong&gt;: API load testing can be easier because you don&amp;rsquo;t have to account for changes in the user interface as long as the underlying API calls are the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s cost-effective&lt;/strong&gt;: You can run about 1,000 users for an API test on a single machine (we used AWS m5.xlarge machines to arrive at this estimate). This translates into fewer resources that you&amp;rsquo;ll need to pay for whether you&amp;rsquo;re running a thousand users or [a million](whether you&amp;rsquo;re running a thousand users or a million), and, ultimately, a lower cost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It lets you narrow your load testing scope&lt;/strong&gt;: If you have a particular endpoint that has historically shown performance issues, you can use API load testing to target just that one endpoint. On a device farm, you would have to create a test automation script that might click a button and send dozens of requests, only one of which you actually wanted to test.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tools-for-mobile-load-testing&#34;&gt;Tools for mobile load testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can use many tools for API load testing, but you can&amp;rsquo;t go wrong with robust open-source tools like JMeter and Gatling. Both tools are well-used tools in the performance industry, and they also have large user bases and ample documentation for helping anyone get started. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll continue with JMeter specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you get started with writing your script? Ideally, your developers should be able to point you to the API documentation for your app or be able to describe the format of the request themselves. But what if you wanted to get started on your own?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-record-network-traffic-from-a-native-app-with-apache-jmeter&#34;&gt;How to record network traffic from a native app with Apache JMeter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://thenewstack.io/how-id-load-test-the-iowa-caucus-app/&#34;&gt;an article on The New Stack&lt;/a&gt; about how I would have load tested the IowaReporterApp, which was responsible for delays in reported vote totals for the 2020 Iowa Democratic Caucuses. To show how to load test that app, I created an actual load testing script for that article, without any input from the app developers. I chose to script using Apache JMeter, a popular open source API load testing tool, but Gatling (also open source) is another good option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the steps I took on my Android mobile, a Samsung Galaxy Note 10+. The same principles should apply to iOS devices and other Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-download-and-install-the-app&#34;&gt;1. Download and install the app.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if the app isn&amp;rsquo;t on the Google Play store, you can install an app using the .apk file. You may have to enable Developer Mode on your phone, which is not the same as jailbreaking. All this does is bypass the security feature that would otherwise not allow you to install apps that don&amp;rsquo;t come from the Play store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enable Developer Mode, go to Settings &amp;gt; About phone &amp;gt; Software information. Then, scroll down to the field Build number and tap it seven times. You should see a confirmation message that Developer mode is on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now download the .apk, click on it, and follow the prompts to install it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-set-up-an-https-test-script-recorder-on-jmeter&#34;&gt;2. Set up an HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder on JMeter&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll need to have JMeter set up already for this step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connect your laptop to a wi-fi network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a new test plan on JMeter, right-click on Test Plan and then click on Add &amp;gt; Non-Test Elements &amp;gt; HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder. Click on it and take note of the port it uses in Global Settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200221-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Checking the port in the JMeter HTTPS Test Script Recorder&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, right-click on the test recorder element you just created and click Add &amp;gt; Listener &amp;gt; View Results Tree. This element shows details of requests and responses when we run tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, right-click on Test Plan again and click Add &amp;gt; Threads &amp;gt; Thread Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, right-click on Thread Group and click Add &amp;gt; Logic Controller &amp;gt; Recording Controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your test plan should look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200221-04.png&#34; alt=&#34;JMeter Test Plan containing a Recording Controller and an HTTPS Test Script Reocrder&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-set-up-your-mobile-to-use-a-proxy&#34;&gt;3. Set up your mobile to use a proxy.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On your mobile, connect to the same wireless network that your laptop is connected to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go back to your laptop and find out its local IP address. On a Mac, you can see this by clicking on the Apple logo &amp;gt; System Preferences &amp;gt; Network &amp;gt; Advanced &amp;gt; TCP/IP. The IPv4 Address is what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for, and it might look something like 192.168.86.125.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200221-05.png&#34; alt=&#34;Getting your local IP address on a Mac&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On your mobile, go to Settings &amp;gt; Connections &amp;gt; Wi-Fi. Under Current network, click on the settings wheel next to your wireless network. Click on Advanced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter your computer&amp;rsquo;s local IP address in the Proxy host name field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Proxy port field, enter 8888, or the port that was displayed in the HTTP(S) Test Script Recorder on JMeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click Save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-start-recording-traffic&#34;&gt;4. Start recording traffic.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On JMeter, click on the HTTP(s) Test Script Recorder element and click Start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On your mobile, open the app and log in or perform the action that you&amp;rsquo;d like to record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you use the app, you should be able to see the requests coming in on JMeter in the View Results Tree:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200221-06.png&#34; alt=&#34;View Results Tree listener view of traffic coming from the proxy&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you click on the Recording Controller, you&amp;rsquo;ll also see the exact format of the requests that the app made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200221-07.png&#34; alt=&#34;Seeing parameters sent with a recorded request in JMeter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scripting-and-troubleshooting-your-mobile-load-testing-script&#34;&gt;Scripting and troubleshooting your mobile load testing script&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you now have is a recording of the mobile traffic you need to simulate. If you stop here and try to run it, you may find that it fails. That&amp;rsquo;s because you haven&amp;rsquo;t done any scripting yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things you&amp;rsquo;ll need to do to turn a recording into a script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-assertions&#34;&gt;Add assertions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An assertion is a way to verify that the request is returning the response that you expect. JMeter only marks a request as failed when it returns an HTTP 4xx or HTTP 5xx response code. However, there are times when the HTTP response code returned is an HTTP 200 OK, but the page that was returned was still not the one you expected. Without assertions, JMeter would mark this request as passed, yielding false positives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you&amp;rsquo;re sending a login request, then a good assertion for the response to that request might be text like &amp;ldquo;Welcome, Nicole&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Logged in.&amp;rdquo; To see the data that should be returned, you can either run through the action manually in your browser and use Developer Tools to inspect the response or click on the response tab in the View Results Tree listener in JMeter from your recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assertions also allow you to pinpoint more accurately where in your script the error is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;replace-hardcoded-values-with-dynamic-values&#34;&gt;Replace hardcoded values with dynamic values&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last screenshot above shows the parameters that the mobile application sends to the server to log in. If you examine the parameter values, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that several of them are long strings. The script fails when you just send the same request again because some of these are dynamic. This means that parts of the request need to change before your device is allowed to access the application. You might need to add a timestamp, the right answer to a challenge, a session or client ID, or codes returned in previous requests. These dynamic values help the server determine whether the login request is a valid login attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where help from a developer would come in handy because he or she can tell you how each parameter value needs to be formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;add-think-time&#34;&gt;Add think time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think time is a delay between requests that simulates the pauses that a real user takes to read text on the page or otherwise interact with your application. Most performance testing tools do this. In JMeter, they are called timers, and there are several to choose from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like the Uniform Random Timer because it allows you to set a constant value for the delay as well as an additional random delay on top of it. I recommend having a variable delay because setting a completely constant delay makes the test too regular and causes unnaturally high load at the interval you set. Real users don&amp;rsquo;t coordinate with each other, so stagger your requests by using a variable component to your think time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;debug-your-test-script&#34;&gt;Debug your test script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you think about scaling up, run your test a few times with one user on your local machine. If you don&amp;rsquo;t get any errors, try other configurations such as running two sequential users and running two threads at the same time. This way, you can test any correlations you&amp;rsquo;ve had to make for those dynamic values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be tempting to skip this step, but it&amp;rsquo;s necessary before scaling up your load test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;set-test-parameters&#34;&gt;Set test parameters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test parameters are settings like the number of threads, ramp-up, and duration, which allow you to shape the pattern of the load you want to generate according to your test scenarios and test cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;number-of-concurrent-users-or-threads&#34;&gt;Number of concurrent users or threads&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the most obvious way to increase load. The more instances of your script running, the more requests are executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can change this in JMeter by clicking on your Thread Group and changing the “Number of Threads (users)” field:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200221-08.png&#34; alt=&#34;Changing the number of threads in JMeter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;ramp-up&#34;&gt;Ramp-up&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In production, load on servers very rarely goes from 0 to 1000 in one second. Even for cases with a very definitive start time (such as an item going on sale at a particular time), the load generally increases gradually. You can simulate this gradual increase by adding ramp-up times in your script. A ramp-up is the amount of time during which new users are added at staggered intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example of what that might look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200221-09.png&#34; alt=&#34;Changing the ramp-up of a test in JMeter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;duration&#34;&gt;Duration&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duration is how long the whole test lasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest way to set these values in JMeter is to use the basic Thread Group. You’ll need to change the fields highlighted below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200221-10.png&#34; alt=&#34;Changing test parameters in JMeter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use the duration, you’ll have to select “Forever” next to Loop Count and “Scheduler” and type in the number of seconds in the Duration field. Otherwise, you can also run the script according to the number of loops, or iterations, that you want to run. However, since response times vary, using the Loop Count as a proxy for duration yields different results from test to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;running-a-shakeout-test-against-your-mobile-application&#34;&gt;Running a shakeout test against your mobile application&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re ready to run on your load generators, resist the urge to jump straight to the peak load you want. This is a great way to incur unnecessary costs. Instead, run a small test with dozens of users. Running locally is for debugging issues in the script. The purpose of running a shakeout test is to spot errors elsewhere, such as in your test environment and your test data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;baselining-your-mobile-application-performance&#34;&gt;Baselining your mobile application performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a baseline is one of the primary goals you’ll have as you start executing load tests. To be able to assess how changes in the environment or code affect application performance, you’ll need a stable point of comparison. To accurately measure the effect of a variable (like a code change), it’s best to keep as much of the other circumstances surrounding the test as fixed as possible. The baseline is your &lt;strong&gt;unchanging&lt;/strong&gt; test scenario that you can use as a point of comparison to assess future performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application you&amp;rsquo;re scripting against, your tool of choice, and your script all affect your performance baseline, so do some experimenting to find out the setup that works best for your situation. This setup includes characteristics like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the number of concurrent users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test duration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;think time, pacing, and all other waits and delays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the script (including how requests are broken up into transactions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;user density&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;user-density&#34;&gt;User Density&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User density is the number of threads that you can run on a node or a load generator. Figuring out user density it essential because all load generators, even virtual ones, have finite resources. Each load generator also has a finite amount of load that it can generate, based on its CPU and memory utilization, among other things. Trying to generate too many users on a single node may result in the node itself being the bottleneck for your test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To accurately assess your application’s performance, your load generators need to remain healthy during the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be helpful to have a number to start with. At Flood, we’ve found that we can reliably run 1000 users using JMeter or Gatling with one of our AWS &lt;a href=&#34;https://aws.amazon.com/es/ec2/instance-types/&#34;&gt;m5.xlarge machines&lt;/a&gt;. For reference, an m5.xlarge machine has 4 VCPUs and 16 GB RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your machine is similarly specced, run a test on a single node with 1000 users. While the test runs, watch the CPU and memory utilization. If the test finishes without either of those consistently hitting over 80%, you’ll know that the node can handle that number of users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me reiterate, though, that you should use the 1000 users figure as a starting point only. You can then figure out your number through trial and error. Increase the number of users past 1000 and watch the resource utilization again. If that still looks good, add some more users and rerun. When you get to a test where the resource utilization hovers above 80%, stop and fall back to the previous number of users. You’ll now have your number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing you might want to play with is the think time and pacing in your script. These waits tend to have a significant impact on resource utilization, so you can expect to be able to run more users per node if you increase your delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re using JMeter, always run your tests in non-GUI mode. GUI mode is great for debugging, but is unnecessarily resource-intensive for real load tests. While you’re at it, disable any listeners you may have that you don’t need to capture results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figuring out the appropriate user density now prevents you from getting inaccurate test results. Running as many users as you can without overloading the load generators is also cost-effective, as you’ll be making sure that you provision only as many nodes as you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;scaling-up-your-load-test-on-the-cloud&#34;&gt;Scaling up your load test on the cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s relatively simple to run a load test on one machine, but if you want to run on two or more machines, things quickly get unwieldy. Here are some options for achieving this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-upload-your-tool-of-choice-and-script-to-every-machine-and-kick-off-each-test-separately&#34;&gt;1. Upload your tool of choice and script to every machine and kick off each test separately.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of running one large load test, think of this method as running several smaller ones at (about) the same time. This is relatively easy to set up, but the main disadvantage is that it’s tedious. You may also need licenses for your tools if you&amp;rsquo;re not using an open source one. You’ll want to ensure that each load generator is as similar as possible to the others in terms of operating system, tool version, and script version. Since each node kicks off a separate test, you’re not going to be able to see a real-time combined view of all the load tests, and after execution, you’ll need to retrieve results files individually and combine them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-use-your-tools-distributed-testing-mode&#34;&gt;2. Use your tool’s distributed testing mode.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMeter has a feature that allows you to scale. This involves setting up agents on each load generator and using scripts to coordinate execution and results collection. This method requires a little bit more know-how and time to set up, but it’s a little more cohesive than the first method. Here are links on how to set this up: Remote Testing with JMeter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-use-a-load-testing-platform&#34;&gt;3. Use a load testing platform.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m admittedly biased, but if I were to go back to doing performance testing consulting work, I would choose Flood to run my tests. A platform like Flood that is built for distributed load testing is an excellent choice because it takes away all the setup considerations. This is the easiest option, especially for teams that are new to load testing or are perhaps less technical, because all the setup is done through a UI. Scaling out in this case just means uploading your script, choosing the number of nodes you want to run and in which region, and all the work is done for you in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While you can run on-premises, I would consider running your test cloud-based infrastructure for greater flexibility and ease of scaling unless you already have a data center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20200221-11.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Running a load test on the cloud is the easiest way to get started with mobile load testing&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happens-next&#34;&gt;What happens next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running your test is just the beginning of mobile performance testing— there&amp;rsquo;s still metrics collection, results analysis, and resolving performance bottlenecks that you uncover. After all, it&amp;rsquo;s what you do with the test results that counts. Remember that performance and load testing, whether for web-based applications or mobile ones, are iterative. The real value comes from building the app performance testing principles discussed here into your release cycles, so that load testing becomes a habit rather than just a one-off exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/load-testing-tutorial-server-monitoring&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/load-testing-tutorial-server-monitoring&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to be a good load tester if you don’t like data, because a lot of the value of the load testing is in the analysis. Even if you successfully generate load against an application, it’s ineffective without enough data to determine how your application coped with the load. At &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io&#34;&gt;Flood&lt;/a&gt;, we’re passionate about data because we know it drives decisions, so we’re always working to improve how we present data generated by our nodes. However, there’s another important source of data that in my experience is too often overlooked by new load testers: your own application servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executing a load test without monitoring server health is like flying blind: you’ll know when you land safely and you’ll know when you crash, but even if you do crash, you won’t know why—or how you can avoid it next time. Monitoring server health is the black box that will tell you what went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-server-metrics-should-you-monitor&#34;&gt;What server metrics should you monitor?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of metrics that you can monitor, and we always recommend that you choose what to measure based on your own specific circumstances, such as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/blog/start-with-why-how-to-write-requirements-for-api-load-testing/&#34;&gt;purpose for your testing&lt;/a&gt; or any previous outages you’ve had in the past. If you’re new to load testing, though, here’s a list of metrics you might consider measuring:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processor Time&lt;/strong&gt; - how much the processor is being utilised&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processor Interrupt Time&lt;/strong&gt; - how much time the processor is spending to handle interrupts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processor Privileged Time&lt;/strong&gt; - the time the processor spends handling overhead activities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processor Queue Length&lt;/strong&gt; - the number of threads that are waiting to be executed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory (Available Bytes)&lt;/strong&gt; - unused memory available to process new requests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Memory Cache Bytes&lt;/strong&gt; - the size of the memory cache, which is where copies of frequently accessed data are stored&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disk I/O&lt;/strong&gt; - number of reads and writes to the disk during the test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disk Idle Time&lt;/strong&gt; - time that disks are not doing work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disk Transfer/sec&lt;/strong&gt; - average number of seconds that an I/O request takes to complete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disk Write/sec&lt;/strong&gt; - average number of seconds that a write request takes to complete&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network I/O&lt;/strong&gt; - bytes sent and received&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-you-determine-which-one-to-use&#34;&gt;How do you determine which one to use?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re still not sure where to start: &lt;strong&gt;At a minimum, you’ll need the CPU and memory utilisation&lt;/strong&gt; (in bold in the list above) of every major component you want to test. These two metrics are vital and if either of these is consistently maxing out at (or close to) 100%, that’s a sign that the component is struggling with the number of requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an aside, CPU and memory over-utilisation is a very common reason for less-than-ideal response times on the load generators, which is why we also show you those metrics on our nodes while you’re running the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20190926-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;A snapshot of the server metrics provided for Flood&amp;rsquo;s servers during execution&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-can-you-monitor-these-metrics&#34;&gt;How can you monitor these metrics?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you get these metrics depends on your budget and your operating system. I’ll start with the free or lower cost methods and work my way up to enterprise solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your servers are running Windows, &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/perfmon&#34;&gt;PerfMon&lt;/a&gt; is a good alternative. It’s built into Windows and the interface allows you to choose the counters that you want to measure and start recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also a JMeter &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/undera/perfmon-agent&#34;&gt;server agent that you can download&lt;/a&gt;, confusingly called “PerfMon” but not to be mistaken with Windows’ PerfMon, that you can install on your (Windows or Linux) server and will gather metrics. It’s normally used in conjunction with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/PerfMon/&#34;&gt;PerfMon JMeter plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20190926-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;Overview of the setup in the PerfMon JMeter plugin&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nagios.org/projects/nagios-core/&#34;&gt;Nagios Core&lt;/a&gt; is another good open-source way to not only collect metrics but also set up alerts when values exceed certain thresholds that you can set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving from free and open-source options to more enterprise solutions, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dynatrace.com/&#34;&gt;Dynatrace&lt;/a&gt; is a powerful tool that allows you to track not just server health but can actually be used to trace individual requests using a custom header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.appdynamics.com/&#34;&gt;AppDynamics&lt;/a&gt; is another fantastic tool that allows you to really drill down to specific SQL queries that take a long time to execute, for example, feeding you important information to give to your DBAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://newrelic.com/&#34;&gt;New Relic&lt;/a&gt; is another good choice for monitoring production as well as test environments, and we particularly love its thread profiling feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other noteworthy tools are the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/system-center/scom/welcome?view=sc-om-2019&#34;&gt;Microsoft System Center Operations Manager&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oem/enterprise-manager/overview/index.html&#34;&gt;Oracle Enterprise Manager&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3134893/new-with-bluestripe-factfinder-8-1&#34;&gt;BlueStripe FactFinder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flood offers out of the box integrations with Dynatrace, AppDynamics and New Relic. If you’re already using one of these tools, you can push the load metrics from Flood into the dashboards that you’re already using, allowing you to see both load metrics and server metrics in the same place. Here’s an example of a dashboard our own Antonio Jimenez created in New Relic which combined Flood-provided metrics with server-side metrics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20190926-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Combined dashboard displaying Flood&amp;rsquo;s front end focused metrics alongside back end focused metrics captured by New Relic&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This view helps with spotting correlations or trends across the different sets of data, such as a response time graph that begins to increase at the same time that server memory utilization does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;putting-it-all-together&#34;&gt;Putting It All Together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having both sides of the puzzle, the metrics from the application servers along with those from our load generators, gives you a more holistic look of your application performance as a whole, and increases the value you get from load testing.  We’d encourage you to take advantage of the 5 free node hours we provide in our trial to give this integrated load testing solution a spin. You can head on over to Flood to sign up for a free trial which will include 5 free node hours and you can drop us a note to get help integrating Flood with your APM solution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Start with Why: How to Write Requirements for API Load Testing</title>

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/start-with-why-how-to-write-requirements-for-api-load-testing&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/start-with-why-how-to-write-requirements-for-api-load-testing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every good test begins with requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may think, “But I’m a tester! I’m not a business analyst!”, and I hear you. But as testers, especially on smaller teams or shorter projects, it’s still part of our job to make sure we know what our clients want. Otherwise, how do we know whether we’ve succeeded or failed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Flood, I often speak to project teams who ask for help interpreting reports. Most of those times, the problem is not that they don’t understand the metrics or what they measure. The problem is that they didn’t set pass or fail criteria in the first place, and so they don&amp;rsquo;t have anything to judge the results against. This is always a big warning sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;which-performance-testing-metrics-are-important-why-are-we-testing-anyway&#34;&gt;Which performance testing metrics are important? Why are we testing, anyway?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirements inform every step of the load testing process. Why are we doing load testing? What exactly do we want to test? How will we know when a test has passed or failed? How will we know if application performance is good enough to go into production? What does “good enough” mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/blog/author/tim-koopmans/&#34;&gt;Tim Koopmans&lt;/a&gt;, co-founder of Flood, coined the acronym SPEAR to describe the different aspects of a performance that should be considered in load testing. This is a great starting point when thinking about what we want our nonfunctional requirements to cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scalability&#34;&gt;Scalability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scalability is the application’s ability to cope with increasing demands by increasing the amount of server resources. This could mean scaling &lt;em&gt;up&lt;/em&gt; (increasing the resources of the dedicated server) or scaling &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; (adding more nodes to shoulder the load). What happens when more users than expected sign up in response to a promotion on your site?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;performance&#34;&gt;Performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most common performance metric is page response time, but there are other considerations to be made here, such as throughput (requests per minute) and the number of concurrent sessions that need to be supported. Things like the total size of the resources on the page, whether or not a CDN is being used, and what to cache are also worth discussing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;elasticity&#34;&gt;Elasticity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elasticity is a relatively newer aspect to performance testing brought about by advances in the cloud that allow application infrastructure to adapt to changes in load. Unlike scalability, elasticity emphasises scaling down as much as it does scaling up. Testing that virtual machines scale up when load increases is important, but testing that virtual machines also scale down when load decreases can also help save on unnecessary costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;availability&#34;&gt;Availability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test for high availability, ask yourself what would happen when (not if) your application’s server fails. Is there another server that the load balancer will seamlessly send traffic towards? Does the throughput fluctuate wildly? If users are connected to one server that fails, is your application smart enough to make new connections to another server? Or will it simply serve up an error page that users won’t know what to do with? Disaster recovery is best tested when there’s no disaster imminent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;reliability&#34;&gt;Reliability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliability encompasses a lot of scenarios, but they all have to do with whether or not your application returns expected responses. Does your error rate increase when you increase the duration of your load test? Are you adding verification steps to your load testing scripts to check whether or not the HTTP 200 response that the application returned is not actually an error page?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-should-my-applications-response-time-be&#34;&gt;What should my application’s response time be?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our clients frequently ask us what the industry standard is for response times, wanting to make sure their applications measure up. The answer, however, is more complicated than a single number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry standards for response time are only useful when applications are very similar. Constantly changing technologies used in web development as well as innate differences in business processes, however, make it very difficult to extrapolate a single number that will apply to all, or even most, applications in a certain industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The home page of one e-commerce app, for instance, might be several seconds slower than that of their main competitor. However, that doesn’t take into account the fact that their app loads a video showcasing new products. Does that mean that the development team should remove the video in order to fall in line with their competition?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, maybe. But not necessarily. It’s a business decision that needs to be made after perhaps using focus groups to determine the impact of the video, forecasting changes in conversion rate due to it, and comparing its projected value to the effects of being slower than the competition. A/B experiments could be used to test these assumptions and gather quantifiable data to support the team decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These factors are often not considered in the search for one number to rule them all, which is why a fixation on that number can be detrimental. Instead, I encourage project teams to brainstorm and come up with their own numbers for all metrics that would be more appropriate for their application. Gathering comparative metrics from a competitor may be part of this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-good-api-load-testing-requirement&#34;&gt;What is a good API load testing requirement?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good requirement, just like any good goal, is SMART:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;specific&#34;&gt;Specific&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vagueness in a requirement leads to vagueness in results interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instead of&lt;/em&gt;: “The performance of the web application…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Try&lt;/em&gt;: “The average response time of the Login transaction&amp;hellip;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;measurable&#34;&gt;Measurable&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure there is a quantifiable way to know whether requirements have been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instead of&lt;/em&gt;: “Decrease user frustration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Try&lt;/em&gt;: “The error rate must be below 3% at peak load.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;agreed-upon&#34;&gt;Agreed Upon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have the appropriate stakeholders been involved?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instead of&lt;/em&gt;: “The system must be able to generate emails as soon as users register.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Try&lt;/em&gt;: “The system must be able to generate a maximum of 100 emails an hour, after which emails are queued.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good example for this is a project I was involved in that aimed to increase the speed with which emails were generated. Unfortunately, the particular email being sent included a big change that many customers were expected to contact the support team about. The problem was that nobody had thought to include Support in the conversation. Once they heard about the expected end result, the support team quickly raised their concern that they would not be able to handle the expected volume of emails unless the emails were staggered. This could have been avoided if they had been brought into discussions from the very beginning, in the requirements gathering phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;realistic&#34;&gt;Realistic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we meet this requirement given the resources available?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instead of&lt;/em&gt;: “All requests must be returned within 5 ms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Try&lt;/em&gt;: “90% of the Catalog page requests should be returned within 3 seconds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;timely&#34;&gt;Timely&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially for nonfunctional testing, consider adding a timeframe to requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instead of&lt;/em&gt;: “The digital code is sent by SMS upon successful client log in at peak load.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Try&lt;/em&gt;: “The digital code will be sent by SMS no later than 5 minutes after successful client log in at peak load.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;go-forth-and-write-great-load-testing-requirements&#34;&gt;Go forth and write great load testing requirements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requirements represent a great opportunity to think things through and make sure everyone on the project team is on the same page about the goals for your load testing. Too often projects skip this phase, only to realise much later that the tests that were executed didn’t address a key stakeholder’s concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In load testing, as in many things: when in doubt about what to do, start with why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/dismantling-cognitive-biases-in-performance-testing&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/dismantling-cognitive-biases-in-performance-testing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developers and testers alike prefer to think of themselves as entirely rational beings, because both software development and software testing do require systematic rigor and logical reasoning. However, the reality is that the human element still comes into play when building and testing software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://testconf.ru/2019/en/nicole-van-der-hoeven/index.html&#34;&gt;this year’s TestCon conference&lt;/a&gt;, held in Moscow, Russia, I delivered a talk on how cognitive biases affect web performance outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the talk, I discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;two types of thinking: fast thinking and slow thinking (from Daniel Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555&#34;&gt;Thinking, Fast and Slow&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;how to influence the sentence duration that judges give perpetrators&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what cognitive biases are and how they can affect performance testing results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a real-life production incident that occurred on Flood and how our team&amp;rsquo;s cognitive biases got in the way of its resolution&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what to do to avoid cognitive biases when testing software&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the video of my full talk:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Performance Testing Interview Questions, Part 3: LoadRunner</title>

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/performance-testing-interview-questions-part-3-loadrunner-interview-questions&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/performance-testing-interview-questions-part-3-loadrunner-interview-questions&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like it or not, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.microfocus.com/en-us/products/loadrunner-load-testing/overview&#34;&gt;LoadRunner&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most popular commercial load test tools, and with good reason. Its protocol support is extensive, and many a load tester has cut his/her teeth on LoadRunner. In this last part of our interview series, we’ll go over some questions you may have to answer when interviewing for a role using Mercury HP MicroFocus LoadRunner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-sort-of-transactions-would-you-put-into-vuser_init-and-vuser_end&#34;&gt;What sort of transactions would you put into vuser_init and vuser_end?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are used for transactions that would only need to run once, at the beginning and at the end of a script. They’re akin to &lt;a href=&#34;http://jmeter.apache.org/&#34;&gt;JMeter&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;code&gt;setUp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tearDown&lt;/code&gt; thread groups. Some things you might put in vuser_init are user logins or navigation to get to the start of the business process you really want to test, and logouts and any data cleanup to reset the application for the next test are common things to put in vuser_end. Note that if you want each virtual user to iterate through a list of user accounts during the test, you &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; want to put logins and logouts in vuser_init and vuser_end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;when-would-you-run-a-script-in-vugen-and-when-would-you-run-it-in-controller&#34;&gt;When would you run a script in VuGen and when would you run it in Controller?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VuGen is short for Virtual User Generator, and it’s where the actual scripting is done. Running in VuGen is good for writing or debugging a script, where you can quickly see where a script fails, what the response is, and what you need to change. You can also step through the code line by line (F10) to more accurately see, for example, variable values changing throughout your script. It’s really only for shaking out scripts with a single user. Running in VuGen also only runs from your local machine. Once you’re ready to run a load test, you’d switch to Controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Controller is like the command center in LoadRunner: from the Controller, you can actually ramp up the number of users and choose from different scenario configuration settings in order to tailor your workload model to the scenario you’re trying to test. Controller also runs the scripts headlessly; it won’t open up a separate instance of VuGen for every user, so it’s a lot more resource intensive. Controller will also allow you to configure remote load generators and run scripts on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-would-you-set-up-loadrunner-to-run-certain-transactions-a-certain-percentage-of-the-time-for-example-for-every-100-users-that-browses-to-a-site-you-want-25-of-them-visiting-each-of-the-about-catalog-contact-and-reviews-pages&#34;&gt;How would you set up LoadRunner to run certain transactions a certain percentage of the time? For example, for every 100 users that browses to a site, you want 25 of them visiting each of the About, Catalog, Contact, and Reviews pages.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can write the code to visit each page in separate Actions. Then, in Runtime Settings, you can modify the run logic, create an Action Block that has all four actions, and assign a percentage to them (25%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can also hard code this in C within the actions, if you’d prefer, but moving these values to Runtime Settings makes it easier to maintain and reuse by other testers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-is-loadrunner-pacing-different-from-how-its-implemented-in-other-tools&#34;&gt;How is LoadRunner pacing different from how it’s implemented in other tools?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most test tools allow you to set a fixed or variable pacing that adds onto however long one iteration takes to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LoadRunner has a pacing feature that allows you to set a specific time and then adds a variable amount of time to your test &lt;em&gt;depending on response times for the included transactions&lt;/em&gt;. So if you set pacing to 5 minutes and one iteration takes 3 minutes to finish, LoadRunner will automatically wait 2 minutes before starting the next one. If it takes 6 minutes, it will not add any more wait time and proceed instead to the next iteration. This comes in handy because you can more accurately predict how many transactions the script will do in a certain amount of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-would-the-traffic-from-a-load-test-on-loadrunner-not-be-seen-in-google-analytics&#34;&gt;Why would the traffic from a load test on LoadRunner not be seen in Google Analytics?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/&#34;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt; runs when the browser of a user downloads and executes a javascript file that then sends information to Google to increment the site statistics for the current visit. However, most traditional load test tools work on the protocol level; that is, they send requests directly to the application server and download resources from a page to simulate users. This means that while they download the Google Analytics script, they don’t execute it, which means the scripted visits aren’t counted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to use Google Analytics to view statistics from a load test, you’ll need to use a browser-level load test tool. LoadRunner actually has this covered with their &lt;a href=&#34;https://marketplace.microfocus.com/appdelivery/content/truclient&#34;&gt;TruClient&lt;/a&gt; protocol, which interacts with elements on the page like a user would. It will also work for testing single-page applications that use &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)&#34;&gt;AJAX&lt;/a&gt; to change the data displayed on a page instead of reloading new pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, for open source alternatives to TruClient, we at Flood prefer &lt;a href=&#34;http://element.flood.io/&#34;&gt;Element&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/blog/load-testing-guide-selenium/&#34;&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt; load testing, both of that will actually open the site in a browser and executed scripts like a real user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/performance-testing-interview-questions-part-2-jmeter-interview-questions&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this part, we’ll go over some questions that are commonly asked in technical interviews about the use of the most popular open-source load testing tool, &lt;a href=&#34;http://jmeter.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Apache JMeter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;using-jmeter-you-record-a-key-business-process-upon-playing-it-back-however-you-notice-an-error-on-the-first-page-what-could-have-gone-wrong-and-how-would-you-fix-this&#34;&gt;Using JMeter, you record a key business process. Upon playing it back, however, you notice an error on the first page. What could have gone wrong and how would you fix this?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While recorders have gone a long way towards making scripting easier, modern security measures like the implementation of viewstates have also made scripting more complicated to record. Some more complicated applications will pass dynamic values in responses that it expects to see in the succeeding request, otherwise the request is blocked. This is great for security, but it also means that you will need to manually extract these values in your script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In JMeter, you would do this by adding a response extractor to your sample that will extract the dynamic string according to rules you set, and then save the string to a parameter. This parameter must then be used in the next request that you send.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While running your test plan, you get the error: &lt;code&gt;java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space&lt;/code&gt;. How do you fix it?
The easy fix is to edit &lt;code&gt;jmeter.bat&lt;/code&gt; and increase the heap memory (search for &lt;code&gt;HEAP&lt;/code&gt;) and increase heap space allocated like this:
&lt;code&gt;HEAP=&amp;quot;-Xms512m -Xmx2048m&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The part in bold increases the heap space to 2 GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it’s also worthwhile looking at your test plan and removing any obvious memory hogs. One of the things we see a lot is enabled listeners that aren’t even being used. Listeners are great while debugging, but should be disabled when running a load test. Writing too many lines to the log is another culprit here that should also be commented out when running important tests. And of course, you should always run JMeter in non-GUI mode during load tests!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;after-running-a-load-test-the-results-show-that-300-transactions-were-executed-with-a-passed-status-and-returning-responses-of-http-200-however-the-dba-tells-you-that-there-were-no-records-written-to-the-database-as-a-result-of-the-transactions-how-would-you-troubleshoot-this&#34;&gt;After running a load test, the results show that 300 transactions were executed with a PASSED status and returning responses of HTTP 200. However, the DBA tells you that there were no records written to the database as a result of the transactions. How would you troubleshoot this?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see this happening with clients all the time, so I think this makes a great technical interview question. This is also why I said earlier that you shouldn’t count on a test tool to tell you a test has passed. It’s possible for a transaction to have the status PASSED and return an HTTP 200 but still be hiding an error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is mainly due to poor scripting that does not include validations that check whether the script has gotten to the right page. For example, you could use a Response Assertion as a child of your home page sample with the words “Welcome, Nicole” to determine whether the user Nicole has logged in successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a critical step, because without it, it’s possible for a server to return a nice error page, or an incorrect one, such as the home page, with an HTTP 200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-do-you-use-a-data-file-to-read-user-account-details-from-a-csv-in-jmeter&#34;&gt;How do you use a data file to read user account details from a CSV in JMeter?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMeter has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#CSV_Data_Set_Config&#34;&gt;CSV Data Set Config Element&lt;/a&gt; built specifically for this purpose. You can simply add one to your test plan, browse to the CSV file that you’d like to use, and select the options for how to share that data among the threads in your JMeter script.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-would-you-go-about-testing-a-website-that-uses-http2-on-jmeter&#34;&gt;How would you go about testing a website that uses HTTP/2 on JMeter?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a JMeter plugin called HTTP/2 Sampler that accomplishes just this. My colleague Jason just wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/blog/jmeter-tutorial-http2-test/&#34;&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; on this very topic, but basically the plugin adds new HTTP/2 versions to the standard HTTP request and request defaults samplers as well as the Simple Data Writer and View Results Tree listener. These elements will need to be used in order to test an application using HTTP/2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-can-you-do-to-synchronise-the-execution-of-multiple-jmeter-instances-on-different-load-generators&#34;&gt;What can you do to synchronise the execution of multiple JMeter instances on different load generators?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache JMeter has released &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/jmeter_distributed_testing_step_by_step.pdf&#34;&gt;this handy PDF file&lt;/a&gt; to describe the steps necessary to run JMeter in distributed mode. This involves installing Java and JMeter on all machines and setting them up in a master and slave configuration so that one machine controls the rest. On the master, you’ll need to add remote hosts to the jmeter.properties file. When everything is set up, you should be able to open up JMeter on the master and do a a remote start of your current test plan on any or all slaves that you choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with this setup is the clunkiness of working with different machines and essentially having to set them up the same way. After the test, there’s the daunting task of logging back onto each machine, gathering the data, and transferring them back into a central repository. Then you’re faced with consolidating the data from each injector in order to see a picture of the whole test. You can see that this set up quickly goes from time-consuming to a nightmare, especially when potentially thousands of different machines are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only there were &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io/&#34;&gt;an easier way&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/performance-testing-interview-questions-part-1-general&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/performance-testing-interview-questions-part-1-general&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;preparation-is-key-for-the-perfect-interview&#34;&gt;Preparation is Key for the Perfect Interview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance testing interviews can be a nerve wracking experience.  We all understand it’s necessary, but we dread it anyway. Each company has its own style of interview, so you may need to prepare differently for each opportunity. This interview series will cover some general sample questions and scenarios as well as my answers to them to help you nail that performance testing interview!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve broken down the potential questions into the most popular categories, so you can prepare easily for your all-important interview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-performance-testing--what-is-load-testing--what-is-stress-testing&#34;&gt;What is Performance Testing?  What is Load testing?  What is Stress Testing?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance testing is the process of systematically determining, quantifying and improving the speed, reliability, and efficiency of an application with the aim of improving user experience. This includes both front-end and back-end performance testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing is a specific type of back-end performance testing where automated scripts are written to send requests in an attempt to simulate the peak user load expected on the application servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress testing takes that one step further and applies load in excess of what is expected in order to determine the maximum capacity of the system under test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-the-difference-between-front-end-and-back-end-performance-testing-which-one-is-more-important&#34;&gt;What is the difference between front-end and back-end performance testing? Which one is more important?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both front-end and back-end performance testing measure how fast an application responds, but they measure different components of that overall user response time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Front-end performance is concerned with how quickly text, images, and other page elements are displayed on a user’s browser page. Back-end performance is concerned with how quickly these elements are processed by the site’s servers and sent to the user’s machine upon request. Front-end performance is the part of the iceberg above the water line, and back-end performance is everything underneath that you can’t see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both are important because they can both determine whether a user continues to use your application. Front-end performance tends to be easier to test and can provide some quick wins due to the large amount of optimisation tweaks that can be done without writing code. Back-end performance tends to be more difficult to test because it often uncovers problems with the underlying infrastructure and hardware that are of a more technical nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;why-does-performance-testing-matter&#34;&gt;Why does performance testing matter?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance testing matters because application performance has a significant impact on user experience. A site that is unreachable or slow to load due to an inability to cope with unexpected load will cause users to browse to competitor’s sites and tarnish the brand’s reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-do-you-know-when-a-load-test-has-passed&#34;&gt;How do you know when a load test has passed?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, you would have discussed your nonfunctional requirements with key stakeholders before load testing begins. This means that you set your own pass criteria before you even run the tests. You would ideally have a list of specific transactions (selected based on criticality or complexity according to the business) whose response time needs to fall under a threshold you’ve predetermined. “Fast” is not specific enough&amp;ndash; a number is better. Depending on what kind of tests you’re running (soak, stress, volume, etc) you may have other nonfunctional requirements about duration, resource utilisation on the server side, or specific outcomes to scenarios you’d like to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a general rule, don’t rely on a load test tool to determine whether your load test has passed. Rely on it to report your results, but always compare the results to the requirements to determine successes or failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-would-you-advise-to-clients-who-say-they-cant-afford-to-performance-test-because-they-dont-have-the-resources-to-maintain-several-load-generators-on-site&#34;&gt;What would you advise to clients who say they can’t afford to performance test because they don’t have the resources to maintain several load generators on site?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the main reason that performance testing has for so long been considered a luxury that only big companies can afford. Luckily technology moves on, and in 2018 we’re at a point where everyone can load test. The big innovation here has been the cloud and the ability to spin up thousands of virtual machines with a few mouse clicks. Services like Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud make it so that every budding entrepreneur can “borrow” the computing hardware necessary to do cloud load testing with thousands of users and then give them back after the test, without the hassle and cost of maintaining them. I would advise the clients to look for a a cloud load testing solution that utilizes virtual machines on the cloud to run their tests affordably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-run-a-load-test-against-a-server-with-4gb-ram-and-the-results-show-an-average-response-time-of-30-seconds-for-a-particular-request-the-production-server-has-been-allocated-8gb-ram-what-would-you-expect-the-average-response-time-of-the-same-request-to-be-in-production-given-the-same-load&#34;&gt;You run a load test against a server with 4GB RAM and the results show an average response time of 30 seconds for a particular request. The production server has been allocated 8GB RAM. What would you expect the average response time of the same request to be in production given the same load?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trick question! While you may be tempted to answer that the response time would be halved to 15 seconds, reality is rarely that convenient. Response times are a factor of so much more than memory. Things like CPU utilisation, network throughput, latency, load balancing configuration, and just application logic are always going to influence load tests. You can’t assume a linear progression in response time just because you’ve upgraded one part of the hardware. This is why it’s important to load test against an environment that is as production-like as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-a-percentile-and-why-would-you-look-at-percentile-response-times-when-you-already-have-average-response-times&#34;&gt;What is a percentile and why would you look at percentile response times when you already have average response times?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A percentile is a statistical measure that describes a value that a certain percentage of the sample either meets or falls under. For example, a 90th percentile response time of 5 seconds means that 90% of the responses took 5 seconds or less to be returned. It can be an important measure because they soften the impact that outliers have on more inclusive measures such as averages. A transaction with an average response time of 2.5 seconds may seem perfectly acceptable to the business, but when the 90th percentile response time is 20 seconds, this is a good reason to investigate further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-are-some-trends-in-performance-testing-that-you-think-will-continue-in-2019-and-beyond&#34;&gt;What are some trends in performance testing that you think will continue in 2019 and beyond?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloud is an easy answer, as the cloud brings some compelling benefits in terms of reduced cost and just ease of use. However, I already touched on that in a previous question, so I’ll talk about another trend: open source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a reason that open source is still around: it works. The main advantage of open source tools is not that they are free, although that is a big part of the appeal. The real advantage is that open source tools are community-based and community-led, which means features get built for it faster than sometimes commercial tools can keep up with, and they’re built by users of the tool themselves. Open source tools like &lt;a href=&#34;http://jmeter.apache.org/&#34;&gt;JMeter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://gatling.io/&#34;&gt;Gatling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://seleniumhq.org/&#34;&gt;Selenium&lt;/a&gt; have revolutionized the industry due to their impressive feature sets, built by a growing community that has developed plugins for everything you can think of. More and more, even big companies with big budgets choose to go open source simply because of the wealth of knowledge of these tools that are already available for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re huge proponents of open source tools at Flood, which is why we recently open-sourced our very own tool, &lt;a href=&#34;https://element.flood.io/&#34;&gt;Element&lt;/a&gt;. We will continue to support all things open source, because we firmly believe that the future is open source.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Should I Upgrade to JMeter 4.0? 5 Reasons to Upgrade</title>

&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/should-i-upgrade-to-jmeter-4-0-5-reasons-to-upgrade&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flood.io/blog/should-i-upgrade-to-jmeter-4-0-5-reasons-to-upgrade&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache has just launched &lt;a href=&#34;http://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi&#34;&gt;JMeter 4.0&lt;/a&gt;, a big step up from their previous release, 3.3, which was only released in September last year. Apache seems to be stepping up the frequency of it’s releases, and we’re not complaining. JMeter is an amazing open source load testing tool and the most popular one used at &lt;a href=&#34;http://flood.io/&#34;&gt;Tricentis Flood&lt;/a&gt; by far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question is: Should you upgrade? Are the new features worth the leap? Will the new black UI make you a better load tester? While this choice should be made on a case-by-case basis and we certainly can’t pretend to give one-size-fits-all advice, here are some good arguments to do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-java-9-support&#34;&gt;#1: Java 9 support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JDK 9 was released back in September 2017, and if you were one of the people who upgraded to it when prompted, you would have noticed to your frustration that JMeter 3.3 did not play well with it, yielding the error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;Error: Java version -- 9.0.1 -- is too low to run JMeter. Needs a Java version greater than or equal to 1.8.0 errorlevel&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good news! This is now fixed. JMeter 4.0 runs smoothly on JDK 9. We&amp;rsquo;ll continue running on JDK 8 at Flood for consistency amongst all our open source load testing tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-new-boundary-extractor&#34;&gt;#2: New Boundary Extractor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, my preferred way to extract dynamic values in JMeter was to use a regular expression extractor, but there’s no doubt that it can sometimes be tricky to get just the right text out of a response. Enter the &lt;a href=&#34;http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#Boundary_Extractor&#34;&gt;Boundary Extractor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boundary extractor allows you to simply set the text immediately before and after the text you want to extract. This saves you wondering whether you should have used a + or a * in your regular expression, and is also easier to validate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20180223-01.png&#34; alt=&#34;Boundary Extractor in JMeter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-new-json-assertion-element&#34;&gt;#3: New JSON assertion element&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While XPath assertion was great, there was previously no counterpart for JSON. The &lt;a href=&#34;http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html#JSON_Assertion&#34;&gt;JSON Assertion&lt;/a&gt; element fills that void nicely, using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/json-path/JsonPath&#34;&gt;JsonPath&lt;/a&gt; to quickly assert the existence (or non-existence, with the Invert assertion option ticked) of a particular element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20180223-02.png&#34; alt=&#34;JSON Assertion element in JMeter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-new-throughput-timer&#34;&gt;#4: New throughput timer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a new throughput timer to play with, and it’s called &lt;a href=&#34;http://home.apache.org/~milamber/jmeter-4.0RC4/docs/usermanual/component_reference.html#Precise_Throughput_Timer&#34;&gt;Precise Throughput Timer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20180223-03.png&#34; alt=&#34;Precise Throughput Timer in JMeter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas the Constant Throughput Timer also had the disadvantage of constant pacing of requests, the Precise Throughput Timer is based on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://home.apache.org/~milamber/jmeter-4.0RC4/docs/usermanual/component_reference.html#Poisson_Random_Timer&#34;&gt;Poisson Random Timer&lt;/a&gt; and randomly generates the delay between each request. The implementation seems to be well thought out, with the component reference section listing a lot of scenarios they’ve tested for that the previous Constant Throughput Timer might have struggled with. Throughput timers are one of my favourite JMeter features, and still rather unique in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-test-plan-autosave&#34;&gt;#5: Test Plan Autosave&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one’s more of a usability tweak, but it’s a good one. JMeter now automatically saves your script when you run a test, saving you from those all-too-familiar “Wait… did I CTRL+S before I hit CTRL+R?” moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Click &lt;a href=&#34;http://home.apache.org/~milamber/jmeter-4.0RC4/docs/changes.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see the full release notes for version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;bonus-reason-tricentis-flood-support&#34;&gt;BONUS reason: Tricentis Flood support&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can now upload JMeter 4.0 scripts to flood.io and be up and running with your first test hosted on one of our grid nodes around the world. Our customer support team is always happy to help you make the switch to 4.0.&lt;/p&gt;
