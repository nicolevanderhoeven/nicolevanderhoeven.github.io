      <title>What Is Load Testing? - A real-world explanation</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made about 60 videos on load testing and application performance to date, but I realized that I&amp;rsquo;ve never made one defining load testing, which seemed like a glaring mistake. So, here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt!
  Rough transcript below - though I went off script a few times:
Load testing is a key part of making sure that an application performs well and reliably. But what IS load testing, anyway? In this video, I break it down for you in simple terms.</description>

      <title>Interview on Performance Time Podcast</title>

      <description>I first heard of Stephen Townshend because he happens to have gotten the same introduction to performance testing that I did&amp;ndash; our shared mentor, Stijn Schephers. He has started a podcast called Performance Time, where he interviews performance engineers about a variety of topics. This week, it was me!
 We talked about how I got started, one of my biggest failures as a performance tester, chaos engineering, what we can do to improve diversity in tech, and why I think note-taking is a key skill for any performance tester.</description>

      <description>This week, we had Odysseas Lamtzidis on the show to talk about Netdata, which is an application performance monitoring tool that prides itself on having the easiest setup ever. Odysseas admitted that it might not have all the bells and whistles of other monitoring platforms, it Just Works. I see this as being very interesting especially for testers like me, who just want to have something set up but might not want to be bothered by the implementation.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Guide for Load Testing</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210524-end-to-end-guide-for-load-testing/</link>

      <description>Originally published on the Abstracta blog.
If you have a public-facing web application, the odds are you should probably be thinking about load testing. Any tester can (and should) add load testing to their repertoire.
Functional tests are often carried out with a single user&amp;rsquo;s experience of your application in mind, but what happens when hundreds or thousands of users are on your site at the same time? Load testing helps prepare an application for this eventuality by simulating that situation before the application goes live.</description>

      <description>We were happy to welcome Nočnica Fee from New Relic to k6 Office Hours. She very bravely volunteered to learn how to use k6&amp;ndash; live! Talk about pressure. But she handled it like a champ!
We also talked about why observability is both particularly important and particularly difficult in serverless architecture. There will definitely be a part two at some point!

      <description>This must be the month for trying new things, because I jumped into livestreaming with the first ever k6 Office Hours just a week ago, and this week I&amp;rsquo;m jumping into podcasting with Simme Aronsson, who&amp;rsquo;s also doing the Office Hours with me. There&amp;rsquo;s definitely safety (at least psychological safety) in numbers, because doing it with someone else makes me feel a little more brave.
While the podcast is presented by k6, that&amp;rsquo;s really just a fancy term for saying that we&amp;rsquo;re both employed by k6 and we&amp;rsquo;re recording and producing the podcast on company time.</description>

      <description>The k6 virtual office is open!
The first time I heard about office hours was from Notion. Recently, Obsidian went in on this trend as well. The concept involves opening your virtual doors regularly to your community, to answer questions and share best practices.
A big part of being a Developer Advocate is talking to people, and even conferences these days are mostly pre-recorded. I kind of miss being able to interact with people.</description>

      <description>I decided to make a final wrap-up video for my &amp;ldquo;Week of Testing&amp;rdquo; with k6&amp;hellip; ok, so it&amp;rsquo;s actually three weeks later now, but I wanted to explore k6 a little bit more before I gave my opinion on it.
  And here&amp;rsquo;s the audio version:
 Thank you, k6, for being awesome enough to agree to this video series before knowing what I&amp;rsquo;d say. Gotta love a company that welcomes transparency and feedback.</description>

 Introducción Hola a todos! Yo soy Nicole van der Hoeven, y soy performance tester. JMeter es una de mis herramientas favoritas porque es gratis, simple, y por muchos casos hace exactamente lo que quiero y no más. Sin embargo, como performers es parte de nuestro trabajo elegir la herramienta adecuada para cada proyecto, y hay que admitir que hay situaciones en que JMeter simplemente no es suficiente.</description>

      <title>Week of Testing: Day 5 - The thing about learning in public</title>

      <description>Yesterday I mentioned that I&amp;rsquo;d used the constant-vus executor to recreate the stepped load profile. Well, the thing about learning publicly is that it also means making mistakes publicly!
I was kindly informed by a few of my new colleagues that constant-vus was not the most optimal way to recreate the stepped load profile. Simme wrote up a little function so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to repeat myself so much, and Pepe Cano and Pawel Suwala (the CTO of k6 himself) both told me nicely that using stages would have been the better solution.</description>

      <description>k6 has a cool feature where even if you start a load test locally via the CLI, you can still stream the results to k6 Cloud. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting compromise between debugging a test locally (and therefore not paying for cloud infrastructure) and sharing results for load tests run on the cloud. It worked seamlessly, too.
I also wanted to see how to recreate a specific load profile that I commonly use - the stepped load profile.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had my fun playing around with k6 Cloud, the SaaS component. For Day 3, I thought it was time to jump into the heart of k6: k6 the open source load testing tool.
First impressions: logging was a little sparser than I expect, coming from having used load testing tools that just do this for me automatically. I think one of the first things I&amp;rsquo;ll do with k6 is to create my own little &amp;ldquo;load testing starting script&amp;rdquo; that I&amp;rsquo;ll always use, with all of the appropriate logging already set up.</description>

      <description>Day 2 of my Week of Testing!
Yesterday I ran my first load test on k6, and actually set up the thresholds wrong. I still maintain that there are some UI improvements that could still be made in that area, and that feedback was well-received. Apparently I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one who has made the same mistake.
Today I learned that on k6, you can actually set one test to be a baseline.</description>

      <description>On my first real day of testing with k6.io, I wanted to jump right in and figure out how to run a load test on k6 Cloud. k6 has documentation on this, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t use it for this test, since the point of a week of testing is to record how easy the product is to use.
My verdict: I&amp;rsquo;m pleasantly surprised with how easily everything went.</description>

      <description>Today was my first day at k6.io! I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve joined as their newest Developer Advocate for Performance Testing. k6 is a company I&amp;rsquo;ve had my eye on for a while, even (or maybe especially) when I was working for a competitor, Tricentis Flood. I always admired k6&amp;rsquo;s stance on open source, their involvement with the developer community, and the slick web app that brings load testing into the hands of many developers and testers.</description>

People often start load testing by creating a script in their favorite load testing tool, but good load testing starts before that. Planning a load test may seem like a tedious exercise, but it is essential to ensuring the success of your testing.
A test plan should answer why, what, who, when, and how the testing will be carried out.
A good test plan, particularly for load testing, includes the following components:</description>

‍API load testing is one of the most popular ways to run a load test because of the number of open source and commercial load testing tools available on the market that support it. Creating a script to hit your application&amp;rsquo;s API endpoints is the traditional approach to load testing, but it&amp;rsquo;s not the only one.
Here are some things to consider when deciding whether or not API load testing is right for your application.</description>

On June 1st, 2020, the National Institute of Health and Environment (RIVM) announced that everyone with certain symptoms could call the hotline 0800-1202 to arrange a free COVID-19 test. The promise: call today, get tested tomorrow, and receive the results the day after that. The reality, though, did not live up to expectations.

Where you run your load test can affect the results that you get as well as your project&amp;rsquo;s bottom line. In general, there are two infrastructure options to consider for load testing your apps: on-premise and cloud. Which type of environment is best for load testing both web or mobile apps?

One of our most commonly-asked questions is: &amp;ldquo;What are the best tools for load testing?&amp;rdquo; The answer will depend on a few things: your reason for load testing, the application you want to test, what kind of load testing you want to carry out, your team&amp;rsquo;s experience with scripting, and how many virtual users you want to run.

On this Ask a Flooder, I talk about getting started with Flood Element. Element is an open-source tool that is a good Selenium alternative for browser-based load testing. It runs Puppeteer under the hood to drive real browsers at scale and can be paired with Flood for cloud load testing.
‍   TRANSCRIPT:
If you&amp;rsquo;re sold on browser-based load testing and want to get started on Element, I think the easiest way to do that is by going to element.</description>

In this Ask a Flooder, I tackle a question we get all the time from users regarding results, particularly for cloud load testing. Sometimes you might notice that response times that are reported in by your load testing tool do not match up with the response time you see from your own browser. What causes this, and how can we fix it?
  Transcript:
It&amp;rsquo;s always confusing when your load testing tool reports higher average response times than what you can see while you&amp;rsquo;re manually accessing your application on your browser.</description>

Angry customers flocked to the internet when the Robinhood investment brokerage app went down last Monday and part of Tuesday, leaving them unable to trade stocks on a day where Wall Street reported historic gains. Could this have been prevented?
The answer is yes. Applications should always be assessed for risk and tested accordingly. Risk-based load testing helps unearth problems that would otherwise only surface in production.</description>

TL;DR? Here are the highlights in this article:
Shadow, Inc. created a mobile app for the Iowa Caucus in February 2020, and the app failed, causing reported results to be delayed. The app reported different vote totals due to a system integration bug where the output was in a different format than what it needed to be. Here are the steps to load testing a mobile app:</description>

In the recent RubyConf 2020 held in Melbourne, Australia, Nancy Cai from AirTasker talked about how they built a performance testing framework using Ruby JMeter and Flood. Luckily, we had some pleasantly surprised Flooders in attendance to take notes during this fantastic talk!
AirTasker is a platform allowing the outsourcing of everyday tasks. When discussing the reasons that AirTasker decided they wanted to carry out performance and load testing, Nancy told a fascinating story about an overly successful marketing campaign—a good problem to have, but a problem nonetheless.</description>

What is mobile load testing? What is the difference between load testing web apps and mobile apps? In general, your goal is the same: to improve app performance by systematically exposing your app to the load you expect, whether it&amp;rsquo;s on the web or on a mobile device. However, while the purpose may be the same, there a few extra things to consider when it comes to mobile app performance, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to make some key mistakes.</description>

It’s difficult to be a good load tester if you don’t like data, because a lot of the value of the load testing is in the analysis. Even if you successfully generate load against an application, it’s ineffective without enough data to determine how your application coped with the load. At Flood, we’re passionate about data because we know it drives decisions, so we’re always working to improve how we present data generated by our nodes.</description>

Every good test begins with requirements.
You may think, “But I’m a tester! I’m not a business analyst!”, and I hear you. But as testers, especially on smaller teams or shorter projects, it’s still part of our job to make sure we know what our clients want. Otherwise, how do we know whether we’ve succeeded or failed?
At Flood, I often speak to project teams who ask for help interpreting reports.</description>

Developers and testers alike prefer to think of themselves as entirely rational beings, because both software development and software testing do require systematic rigor and logical reasoning. However, the reality is that the human element still comes into play when building and testing software.
In this year’s TestCon conference, held in Moscow, Russia, I delivered a talk on how cognitive biases affect web performance outcomes.
In the talk, I discuss:</description>

Like it or not, LoadRunner is one of the most popular commercial load test tools, and with good reason. Its protocol support is extensive, and many a load tester has cut his/her teeth on LoadRunner. In this last part of our interview series, we’ll go over some questions you may have to answer when interviewing for a role using Mercury HP MicroFocus LoadRunner.
What sort of transactions would you put into vuser_init and vuser_end?</description>

In this part, we’ll go over some questions that are commonly asked in technical interviews about the use of the most popular open-source load testing tool, Apache JMeter.
Using JMeter, you record a key business process. Upon playing it back, however, you notice an error on the first page. What could have gone wrong and how would you fix this? While recorders have gone a long way towards making scripting easier, modern security measures like the implementation of viewstates have also made scripting more complicated to record.</description>

Preparation is Key for the Perfect Interview Performance testing interviews can be a nerve wracking experience. We all understand it’s necessary, but we dread it anyway. Each company has its own style of interview, so you may need to prepare differently for each opportunity. This interview series will cover some general sample questions and scenarios as well as my answers to them to help you nail that performance testing interview!</description>

Apache has just launched JMeter 4.0, a big step up from their previous release, 3.3, which was only released in September last year. Apache seems to be stepping up the frequency of it’s releases, and we’re not complaining. JMeter is an amazing open source load testing tool and the most popular one used at Tricentis Flood by far.
The big question is: Should you upgrade? Are the new features worth the leap?</description>
