      <description>Places I&amp;rsquo;ve worked k6.io (2020-Present) Developer Advocate (remote)
I joined k6.io in November 2020 as a Developer Advocate, specializing in Performance Testing. k6 is a free and open source tool for load testing, with the goal of making the process as developer-friendly as possible. The company also has a related SaaS platform, k6 Cloud, which is an easy way to scale up load tests on the cloud.
So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a series of videos on YouTube covering my Week of Testing of the k6 ecosystem.</description>

      <description>Today was my first day at k6.io! I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve joined as their newest Developer Advocate for Performance Testing. k6 is a company I&amp;rsquo;ve had my eye on for a while, even (or maybe especially) when I was working for a competitor, Tricentis Flood. I always admired k6&amp;rsquo;s stance on open source, their involvement with the developer community, and the slick web app that brings load testing into the hands of many developers and testers.</description>
