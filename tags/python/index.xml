      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve recently transitioned from Roam Research to Obsidian, you might run into a few issues, even after you&amp;rsquo;ve run the &amp;ldquo;Markdown format importer&amp;rdquo; core plugin. One of the most annoying ones that I ran into was that files uploaded to Roam (images, pdfs, etc.) are automatically uploaded to Google Firebase.
Roam assets are linked to in the Markdown files like this:
![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-471a1.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FMyNotes%2FxRFXx7l-ZK.png?alt=media&amp;amp;token=1e03b680-5472-33dc-9b06-a127301af37f) Now, since Roam relies on security by obscurity on this front, the links to your assets will still be accessible in your Obsidian vault, and they&amp;rsquo;ll still render correctly.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m about 9 months into heavily using Roam Research as my primary note-taking, task management, capture-everything system, and for the most part, that&amp;rsquo;s gone very well. Obsidian is another excellent personal knowledge management (PKM) system, though, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been curious about it for almost as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Roam. I&amp;rsquo;ve had it installed for a while, but I never really seriously attempted to make the switch. Until now.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m starting off the new year by learning something new. I am a big fan of non-traditional education, and Coursera is a platform I&amp;rsquo;ve used a few times before. You may not get courses that qualify as university credit, but I&amp;rsquo;ve found it to be a useful resource for learning. I might be biased (my university degree is in Economics, which I&amp;rsquo;ve never used), but in some ways, I actually prefer a MOOC (that&amp;rsquo;s a Massively Open Online Course) to a typical formal university course for a few reasons:</description>
