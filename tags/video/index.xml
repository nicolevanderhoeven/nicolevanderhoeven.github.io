      <title>Application Performance Monitoring using Netdata and k6, with Odysseas Lamtzidis (k6 Office Hours)</title>

      <description>This week, we had Odysseas Lamtzidis on the show to talk about Netdata, which is an application performance monitoring tool that prides itself on having the easiest setup ever. Odysseas admitted that it might not have all the bells and whistles of other monitoring platforms, it Just Works. I see this as being very interesting especially for testers like me, who just want to have something set up but might not want to be bothered by the implementation.</description>

      <description>We were happy to welcome Nočnica Fee from New Relic to k6 Office Hours. She very bravely volunteered to learn how to use k6&amp;ndash; live! Talk about pressure. But she handled it like a champ!
We also talked about why observability is both particularly important and particularly difficult in serverless architecture. There will definitely be a part two at some point!

      <description>We managed to get two other folks from k6 to join our Office Hours: our CEO, Robin Gustafsson, and our Head of Customer Success, Mark Meier. We took advantage of the opportunity to discuss wishlist features for k6 and bug Robin about how likely each feature was to see the light of day!

      <description>Today, I attended the Cambridge University Press QA Week 2021 to talk about load testing with k6. Here&amp;rsquo;s a recording of the presentation.
  And here are the slides I used!
I had fun discussing the advantages of the load test as code approach and why k6 is a great way to implement it.</description>

      <description>This is a travel video from January 2020, when my husband Rob and I did a roadtrip in Scotland with our good friends, Nikki and Basti Filler. This is towards the tail end of that trip, and it involved some of the best scenery I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen. Scotland is a gorgeous country that we thoroughly enjoyed exploring, despite its awful weather. As a bonus, this was also our first trip with our new niece, Cassie.</description>

      <description>This must be the month for trying new things, because I jumped into livestreaming with the first ever k6 Office Hours just a week ago, and this week I&amp;rsquo;m jumping into podcasting with Simme Aronsson, who&amp;rsquo;s also doing the Office Hours with me. There&amp;rsquo;s definitely safety (at least psychological safety) in numbers, because doing it with someone else makes me feel a little more brave.
While the podcast is presented by k6, that&amp;rsquo;s really just a fancy term for saying that we&amp;rsquo;re both employed by k6 and we&amp;rsquo;re recording and producing the podcast on company time.</description>

      <description>The k6 virtual office is open!
The first time I heard about office hours was from Notion. Recently, Obsidian went in on this trend as well. The concept involves opening your virtual doors regularly to your community, to answer questions and share best practices.
A big part of being a Developer Advocate is talking to people, and even conferences these days are mostly pre-recorded. I kind of miss being able to interact with people.</description>

      <description>Originally posted on k6.io.
  Introduction When I joined the k6 team in late November, the foremost question on my mind was &amp;ldquo;How does this compare to JMeter?&amp;rdquo; You see, I come from a performance testing consulting background, and in the last few years, JMeter has been far and away my tool of choice.
So what am I doing on the k6 site, talking about how much I love JMeter?</description>

  And here&amp;rsquo;s the audio version:
 Thank you, k6, for being awesome enough to agree to this video series before knowing what I&amp;rsquo;d say. Gotta love a company that welcomes transparency and feedback.</description>

  Y la versión audio:
 Introducción Hola a todos! Yo soy Nicole van der Hoeven, y soy performance tester. JMeter es una de mis herramientas favoritas porque es gratis, simple, y por muchos casos hace exactamente lo que quiero y no más. Sin embargo, como performers es parte de nuestro trabajo elegir la herramienta adecuada para cada proyecto, y hay que admitir que hay situaciones en que JMeter simplemente no es suficiente.</description>

      <title>Week of Testing: Day 5 - The thing about learning in public</title>

      <description>Yesterday I mentioned that I&amp;rsquo;d used the constant-vus executor to recreate the stepped load profile. Well, the thing about learning publicly is that it also means making mistakes publicly!
I was kindly informed by a few of my new colleagues that constant-vus was not the most optimal way to recreate the stepped load profile. Simme wrote up a little function so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to repeat myself so much, and Pepe Cano and Pawel Suwala (the CTO of k6 himself) both told me nicely that using stages would have been the better solution.</description>

      <description>k6 has a cool feature where even if you start a load test locally via the CLI, you can still stream the results to k6 Cloud. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting compromise between debugging a test locally (and therefore not paying for cloud infrastructure) and sharing results for load tests run on the cloud. It worked seamlessly, too.
I also wanted to see how to recreate a specific load profile that I commonly use - the stepped load profile.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had my fun playing around with k6 Cloud, the SaaS component. For Day 3, I thought it was time to jump into the heart of k6: k6 the open source load testing tool.
First impressions: logging was a little sparser than I expect, coming from having used load testing tools that just do this for me automatically. I think one of the first things I&amp;rsquo;ll do with k6 is to create my own little &amp;ldquo;load testing starting script&amp;rdquo; that I&amp;rsquo;ll always use, with all of the appropriate logging already set up.</description>

      <description>Day 2 of my Week of Testing!
Yesterday I ran my first load test on k6, and actually set up the thresholds wrong. I still maintain that there are some UI improvements that could still be made in that area, and that feedback was well-received. Apparently I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one who has made the same mistake.
Today I learned that on k6, you can actually set one test to be a baseline.</description>

      <description>On my first real day of testing with k6.io, I wanted to jump right in and figure out how to run a load test on k6 Cloud. k6 has documentation on this, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t use it for this test, since the point of a week of testing is to record how easy the product is to use.
My verdict: I&amp;rsquo;m pleasantly surprised with how easily everything went.</description>

      <description>Today was my first day at k6.io! I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve joined as their newest Developer Advocate for Performance Testing. k6 is a company I&amp;rsquo;ve had my eye on for a while, even (or maybe especially) when I was working for a competitor, Tricentis Flood. I always admired k6&amp;rsquo;s stance on open source, their involvement with the developer community, and the slick web app that brings load testing into the hands of many developers and testers.</description>

Load testing can be a pretty intimidating field to get into, but it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get started. Here are some concrete steps you can take to start learning how to load test from scratch.
In this video, Flood co-founder Tim Koopmans and I teamed up at Tricentis User Conference 2020 to talk about the essential ingredients for load testing.

JMeter is an open-source load testing tool that is already robust, but there are some fantastic plugins that have been developed for it that you might want to use in your next load test.

One of our most commonly-asked questions is: &amp;ldquo;What are the best tools for load testing?&amp;rdquo; The answer will depend on a few things: your reason for load testing, the application you want to test, what kind of load testing you want to carry out, your team&amp;rsquo;s experience with scripting, and how many virtual users you want to run.
Note: In this video, I say that traditional load testing tools can&amp;rsquo;t simulate requests that are triggered by interactions on the client-side.</description>

In this Ask a Flooder, I tackle a question we get all the time from users regarding results, particularly for cloud load testing. Sometimes you might notice that response times that are reported in by your load testing tool do not match up with the response time you see from your own browser. What causes this, and how can we fix it?
