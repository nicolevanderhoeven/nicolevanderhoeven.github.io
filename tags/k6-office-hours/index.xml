      <description>This week, we had Odysseas Lamtzidis on the show to talk about Netdata, which is an application performance monitoring tool that prides itself on having the easiest setup ever. Odysseas admitted that it might not have all the bells and whistles of other monitoring platforms, it Just Works. I see this as being very interesting especially for testers like me, who just want to have something set up but might not want to be bothered by the implementation.</description>

      <description>We were happy to welcome Nočnica Fee from New Relic to k6 Office Hours. She very bravely volunteered to learn how to use k6&amp;ndash; live! Talk about pressure. But she handled it like a champ!
We also talked about why observability is both particularly important and particularly difficult in serverless architecture. There will definitely be a part two at some point!

      <description>The k6 virtual office is open!
The first time I heard about office hours was from Notion. Recently, Obsidian went in on this trend as well. The concept involves opening your virtual doors regularly to your community, to answer questions and share best practices.
A big part of being a Developer Advocate is talking to people, and even conferences these days are mostly pre-recorded. I kind of miss being able to interact with people.</description>
