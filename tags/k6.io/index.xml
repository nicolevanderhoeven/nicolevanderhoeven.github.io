&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, and welcome to another k6 office hours. I am Nicole van der Hoeven, and for the first time, all three of us developer advocates are in one stream. Could you please introduce yourselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, who&amp;rsquo;s going first?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right, age before beauty, as they say. Okay, well, hey, I&amp;rsquo;m Paul Balogh, the newest DevRel here at k6, nice to meet you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And on my end Leandro Melendez, also known as a Senor Performo, very happy to contribute here and bringing, usually it&amp;rsquo;s knowledge, but this time I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be a little bit on the learning side, which is super exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We learn together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I mean, I don&amp;rsquo;t think you can really have one without the other. I think it&amp;rsquo;s super valuable to also just ask questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Nicole, I&amp;rsquo;m a little disappointed that you don&amp;rsquo;t have a fake mustache to support Leandro and I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. That is not something that I just have lying around, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We may have to fix that. I was commenting the equivalent here in Mexico is the unibrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could potentially draw something on my face, maybe, I could try that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that the Frida Kahlo?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, Leandro and Paul are relatively new to k6. I think you both have been here for less than a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a month here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, just a month now, that&amp;rsquo;s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is the first time, I&amp;rsquo;ve been here with you with each of you separately, but this is the first time that all three of us are here. It is pretty cool, welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exciting, hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s not overload for everybody watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. One thing that I wanted to get out of the way is that we have a very awesome community, we have several community champions, but one of them, NaveenKumar, just posted a couple of videos on how to use checks and thresholds in k6. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to put that in the comments, as well, because I thought that they were pretty awesome videos. NaveenKumar has a YouTube channel where he goes through a bunch of different tools, including k6, but also like JMeter and Gatling, and he always does a good job, so check those out. Oops, I actually didn&amp;rsquo;t post his videos, I think I posted the documentation for what we were talking about, so that&amp;rsquo;s a little premature. Sorry about that, let me put the actual links this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this is a live podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, obviously. Sorry, you get what you get. So if that hadn&amp;rsquo;t already tipped you off, what we actually want to about today are scenarios and executors in k6. You may have been confused by the thumbnail because it was like, I realized afterwards, that it was the three of us, our photos, and then the words executors in k6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here come the executors, the three of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess that&amp;rsquo;s our new name or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know, if you invert the k6 logo, it almost looks like a guillotine, so maybe we are the executors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had not noticed that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a little morbid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, you know, hey, I do what I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re going like play Beatles songs backwards and all that type of stuff, man. I&amp;rsquo;m sure it was not on purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It looks like we&amp;rsquo;ve lost access to LinkedIn for some reason, but, oh well, this has happened before. Thank you, Mark, for saying we&amp;rsquo;re killer performance engineers, love the pun. So the reason that I wanted to talk about this was that, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if you also have got the same, Leandro, Leandro and I were both in the Automation Guild 2022. We both had a talk there and there are a lot of common questions that come up with regards to load testing. And a lot of it has to do with the results, specifically when, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if you can actually hear the wind in my background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is that you, oh wow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m okay, but apparently there&amp;rsquo;s a storm that&amp;rsquo;s in Northern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was gonna say, hopefully you&amp;rsquo;ll still be in Kansas, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know. It&amp;rsquo;s like 140 kilometer per hour winds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t end up in Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But can I be the straw man, at least, in this Oz thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always liked him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;rsquo;m Dorothy. Or the wizard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ask Toto, please.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got Toto around here somewhere, let her in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So one question that I was getting a lot, or I saw other people talking about variations of it, was the situation where you might have already run your load test and seen all check marks and everything passed, and the response times were within the expected results, and yet when the application goes live, suddenly there&amp;rsquo;s all these errors, and performance issues, and maybe production incidents that you never saw in any of your tests. And the question is, how can that be when you&amp;rsquo;ve done your testing and you didn&amp;rsquo;t find any of that and you only see it in production?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, of course I experienced that several times, but many things come to mind on, in what environment did you test? What happened in this environment? If you test in production, hopefully &amp;lsquo;cause we are modern performance engineers that are not afraid of testing in production. Settings, changes, what was the workload? I mean, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, the list is pretty long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, there&amp;rsquo;s a lot that, that could, that&amp;rsquo;s why that question is hard to answer because there&amp;rsquo;s no one answer. It&amp;rsquo;s like, oh and that happens, always check this. And that&amp;rsquo;s also because it could be that there&amp;rsquo;s something different with the environment. Like maybe it&amp;rsquo;s you didn&amp;rsquo;t test the same version of the code even, or maybe you were testing in not a production-like environment in terms of size, or test data, or something like that. But another reason that I think is easier because we testers normally control it is on the side of the script. It could be that you weren&amp;rsquo;t testing the things that you actually wanted to test. And a big part of that, I think, is workload modeling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s one that I also wanted to comment, &amp;lsquo;cause that has been a pain in different occasions. On one hand, watch model, &amp;lsquo;cause from what you&amp;rsquo;re saying, there were these projects where in the end we were told, hey, this is a workload, this is a utilization that we are expecting to have in production or that we actually have in production, we want you to test for this. And it was nothing like that. We were told, yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s a thousand clicks per day, but you wanna test an emergency center when there&amp;rsquo;s a tornado. How is that true, how is that relevant, or vice versa? For some reason, our scripts are just simulating a thousand clicks per day where it&amp;rsquo;s 10,000 billions, gazillions, what would&amp;rsquo;ve been the right thing. Of course your performance test is gonna be awesome if you underdid it. And the other side of the risk, everyone running and, like, the system is dying, what is happening? Oh, we&amp;rsquo;re pressing it too hard, sorry, our bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s true, could go both ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But definitely you always have to worry about configuration drift anyway. Differences in your environments, unless you&amp;rsquo;re using something like a terraform or something, infrastructure is code where you can make sure that your environments are equal. So if you do your load testing and performance testing in a lower environment or isolated environment that it gets some of that, that it is truly configured the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, even when the environments are exactly identical, though, let&amp;rsquo;s just say that it&amp;rsquo;s possible to say that, yeah, there are still situations where if your load tests weren&amp;rsquo;t simulating realistic enough load, then you can&amp;rsquo;t really, you may not be able to apply those results to production either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And one thing, as I said earlier, on one hand, the problem to getting those realistic numbers, at times, the team doesn&amp;rsquo;t even know, they have no idea what are you asking for. All they know is we want to be able to handle 10 users in the system. I&amp;rsquo;m kind of simplifying it, usually it&amp;rsquo;s 10 billion users or something like that, right. Okay, 10 billion users, what does that translate into in terms of utilization? And they go like utiliti-what? And that&amp;rsquo;s the first struggle, right. Supposing that you get the right numbers that you know exactly how much to stress each thing, &amp;lsquo;cause there there&amp;rsquo;s another differentiator, right. We get this action a thousand times, okay, but to get to that action at times or on some systems that are the same, you have to do others many more times, less times, and they are just telling you about this one. What is the proportion, how much to stress the other one that the other one does need not that many times? So that&amp;rsquo;s one discussion. If you get the numbers right then to landing it into the script and your scenarios, also, it&amp;rsquo;s a very interesting situation, headache-bringing situation at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think part of the problem is that a lot of times, when we think about load testing, there are only a few parameters that we think about immediately. One them is the number of virtual users. Another one is the test duration. And sometimes you might get like a request per second, like you were saying, Leandro, but those three don&amp;rsquo;t really describe the shape of a load. It&amp;rsquo;s kind of like trying to encapsulate test results into an average figure, like when you get the geometric mean of something, it&amp;rsquo;s not a great way to express the distribution. You know, if you say that the average response time is three seconds, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that you don&amp;rsquo;t have really high response times. Like you could still have a handful of requests that are at 15 seconds, but maybe the rest of them are a hundred milliseconds. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t really&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurately describe the whole context, the big picture of the load. And in the same way, things like the number of virtual users, and duration, and requests per second also don&amp;rsquo;t show the entire picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, wen you&amp;rsquo;re describing it that way, it makes me think when you are asked to describe someone, oh, has beautiful glasses. I mean, I was talking about Paul, sorry, Nicole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, no, I like your glasses, too. But you need a full picture, right? There are so many elements that a scenario or a workload model includes, so many variations, details that, yeah, as you were saying, I need 10 million users in the system doing what, how often, how long, how many of them are doing which ones? And many of those things, you have to get into the weeds to truly understand and design &amp;lsquo;cause this is another one, you will want different workloads for different type of load scenarios. You should not, I was gonna say you cannot, but you can try, but it&amp;rsquo;s not recommended at all to try to kill too many birds with a single stone. You may be able to get two, but more than that gets complicated, gets crazy. So you have to create a work model for that specific risk situation, that scenario that you want to test for. Just one at a time gets challenging, getting all those components, all those items and things that you need to be careful putting together to model and simulate something that resembles realistically that risk scenario, that risk circumstance that you want to test for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here you go again with that killer mentality there, killing multiple birds with one stone. And now Mark&amp;rsquo;s making comments here that actually for killers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, okay, let&amp;rsquo;s say you may be looking for a needle into multiple haystacks, no killing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking about what you were saying about the hypothetical scenario of a thousand requests over 24 hours. There&amp;rsquo;s still so many ways to interpret that, right? Because it could be, one interpretation could be, take a thousand requests divided by 24 hours and that&amp;rsquo;s the amount of load that you want to test with a one-hour load test. It could be like that, but if it&amp;rsquo;s emergency services, there are certain times of the day when emergencies are more likely. It could be seasonal, as well, like the incidents of emergencies of ambulances that are sent out increases over the holidays for inexplicable reasons. That kind of thing does give more context than just a thousand over 24 hours. I mean, if you just look at a period of 24 hours, those thousand could have been simulated, could have happened in one hour for all you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step in a little far from the ambulance example, don&amp;rsquo;t wanna go more on the killer topic. Let&amp;rsquo;s think of a restaurant, if they say, this Golden Arches restaurant, we sell a thousand burgers per day. Okay. Most probably you are selling 80% of that at lunchtime and the rest of the hours we don&amp;rsquo;t care about. So those different behaviors during that period of time is what we should focus on, or care for, or have better information. Well, in the morning you get more, what&amp;rsquo;s the name of the thing, hash Browns, no burgers. Even if you are the same restaurant, which one do you want to simulate? What is the utilization at different periods in time during the day? &amp;lsquo;Cause yeah, probably no one, not that many people get a milkshake in the morning, but most of them getting in the night. So some of those variations, you want to make sure that you are doing the right mix, not only how many at a single number per long period of time, what happens each hour of the day, which ones do you care for. As a restaurant, I would say I don&amp;rsquo;t wanna simulate a load test of, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, after lunchtime where everyone is gone and we are super quiet. I don&amp;rsquo;t care load test-wise, right. But lunch time, breakfast time, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, 7:00 AM in a gym, I want to test those type of things of what people are doing and focus on, get a good work load model for what is happening at those times, right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I thought, Mark has a couple comments here. I think also the number of vusers or threads compared to the target arrival rate or expected response time for me is the health of the workload generation. And he follows up with, also synchronizing or rendezvous vuser requests is underused in my opinion. Do you agree, Leandro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s in my personal experience, there have been a few times, at least on the render view or synchronizing part, there are not that many times where I had to leverage those functionalities. I think it kind of depends on the projects that you work on. One that comes to mind, and I really love this example for workload modeling in general, is I worked at a gaming company, Australia&amp;rsquo;s largest gaming company, and the project that I worked on was for the Melbourne Cup. So they sold tickets for the Melbourne Cup. And if you don&amp;rsquo;t know, and probably you don&amp;rsquo;t unless you&amp;rsquo;re Australian, but the Melbourne Cup is a horse race. It is like a two-minute horse race that is for some reason incredibly popular in Australia, in my state, in Victoria, &amp;lsquo;cause I lived in Melbourne, we actually got a public holiday for it. So, it&amp;rsquo;s that big. And for some companies, for a lot of these betting companies, the revenue from that one race could be up to 80% of the entire year&amp;rsquo;s revenue. So it is that big.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just in that two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and that&amp;rsquo;s the thing. Betting is open until the race starts. And yet when you look at the workload model for that, it really, the load spikes, the betting spikes just in the few seconds before the race. And that&amp;rsquo;s for a number of reasons, people might not have had the chance to bet earlier in the week because they were working or something. And if you have a public holiday, then you do have the time to just be there watching. And also there are, depending on the types of bet that you placed, there could be a difference in odds. So they&amp;rsquo;re trying to get the last possible information that they can before they have to make a decision about which horse to back. And that&amp;rsquo;s a good case for a rendezvous because there is a clear cutoff and sometimes you see the reverse, like for example, in a university portal or one of these shopping sales, where at midnight all the sales go live. And so you get people maybe refreshing that page all up to that point and then, bam, all of a sudden they start checking out things. And that would be, I think, a good time to use rendezvous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, and in a quick example, you got me thinking, as well, video gaming, when you are on these multiplayer games, most probably everyone watching this are familiar, campaigns, online campaigns, certainly there are so many things happening, there are people playing other things, but a campaign is gonna start at this moment, this schedule. I think there a rendezvous would be a very good use of those type of things. Sadly, in my experience, some of those situations were solved with a spike scenario run out here with an average day in production, so overlapping scenarios. But that&amp;rsquo;s interesting &amp;lsquo;cause, as well, it depends on how do you want to tackle that problem. We are going to have a normal day and suddenly something&amp;rsquo;s gonna happen. How do we simulate it? How do we model that workload? What tools do we use? That&amp;rsquo;s a very good point, and again, with performance testing and load testing, there&amp;rsquo;s no one size fit all or the way to do everything. No, it depends, and you can get two very similar loads, simulations, workloads with different approaches, with different things. And that&amp;rsquo;s one that I also wanted to mention, like when modeling, it&amp;rsquo;s something that when you wanna try to get, there are two elements that I like a lot and I struggle a lot of times, when you are modeling your workloads, you have to somewhat randomize the actions. A big thing that we used to leverage in the load runner days was randomized think time in between steps. But eventually you have to say, okay, it&amp;rsquo;s randomized, it&amp;rsquo;s happening, like real people is using the system, but in the end I want just this process, just this virtual user to iterate a thousand times in an hour. Oh, but I have random times in between, okay let&amp;rsquo;s, that modeling, as well, I can tell got so interesting. And even like mathematic, not too complex, but mathematic functions like, okay, over time we have this deviation, if everything goes in the higher random wait time, we may get up here, we may get down there, so on average we&amp;rsquo;ll be simulating this. It&amp;rsquo;s all so challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, those delays are definitely part of the workload model. In k6, we call them sleep. In JMeter, they&amp;rsquo;re timers. LoadRunner is think time. There are a lot of different terms for it, but basically a delay is some sort of planned sleep in your script that is meant to simulate a real user maybe taking time to think about what they&amp;rsquo;re going to do next, or read the text on the screen, or type out something in a form. And it actually can have a pretty significant impact on your load tests. First of all, if you don&amp;rsquo;t have any think time at all, then you need to be careful that you&amp;rsquo;re not maxing out your CPU and memory utilization on your load generator because that situation where you&amp;rsquo;re just very quickly firing off requests may not be entirely realistic. And I think that if you have think time that&amp;rsquo;s always the same time, like this is what you were talking about, having dynamic ones, if you always use the same value for your think time, you might see the staggering in your results, but that&amp;rsquo;s due to how your test is set up and not at all to do with how your application is responding. And then if you use dynamic think time, like you said, it can make it harder to plan because it&amp;rsquo;s more difficult to know exactly how many iterations your test is going to complete. So there&amp;rsquo;s always trade-offs, right. There&amp;rsquo;s no one way that&amp;rsquo;s always the best way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it depends, as well, on what are you actually trying to simulate. As you mentioned, there are times where we put think times that want to simulate a real person using the system. There are some others where you just don&amp;rsquo;t want these events to happen at the same time. To give you an example would be like if your script was a soldier marching one, two, one, two, and you&amp;rsquo;re adding soldiers at the same pace, one, two, eventually they all will be doing the same step at the very same time. If you are simulating a military parade or something like that, that&amp;rsquo;s awesome. You have the test. On that time, you may want that to happen or, or work it out with some rendezvous continuously happening. But if not, if you just want to simulate a regular march or people passing in the subway, they are not like one, two, one, it would be very interesting to see, but that&amp;rsquo;s not how real people walk in the every day. There are situations for everything, and it&amp;rsquo;s challenging at times, as you say, not only wait in between steps, but waiting after you complete a cycle and you want to start another one. There, you may also want some randomization or not to be that static so that your generally load simulations do not have to be that robotic, even if they are done by robots or virtual users. So there are several trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have an extension to your metaphor, I think you&amp;rsquo;ll like, Leandro, what if instead, this is a way that your script might change depending on the business processes and the context of the industry. So what if instead of trying to simulate a military, what you&amp;rsquo;re actually trying to do is simulate Fremen running across the open sand, trying to not have patterns in their steps to avoid attracting Shai-Hulud, the great worm. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know the reference, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. But in that case you do not want anything constant. You want something more dynamic, something that isn&amp;rsquo;t easily noticeable, that won&amp;rsquo;t skew the results as much. Oh, we have a question from ChipsAho. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s just the Filipino thing, but there&amp;rsquo;s actually a good packet of cookies that&amp;rsquo;s called Chips Ahoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahoy, love them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are faced with budget constraints, how would you prioritize the workload model to use? That&amp;rsquo;s really good. And they follow up with, as performance engineers, I know sometimes our curiosity tends to get the best of us, trying to see how the system behaves in different circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, answering to, oh yeah, ChipsAho, is from Ahoy, very good cookies, put &amp;lsquo;em in the microwave eight seconds and you&amp;rsquo;ll love &amp;lsquo;em. So it depends a lot, I would say, and your budget constraints, what are you testing would be my question. What risks does your application will face, or what are the most common reasons? Again, there&amp;rsquo;s no silver bullet or single test that will clear all your performance risks ever again that you may have under loads. What loads were you? What things may harm your system? Those are the ones that you need to focus and prioritize based on that risk. If you already tested one, you know that it&amp;rsquo;ll survive, next test, maybe go to the next one and down the ladder, the risk ladder. But first it depends on your system. What is it going to subject to? What are the processes? And the risks may be different a spring ago from today. You may be releasing a new process that is super critical, super dangerous, will be touching databases or doing important or even dangerous queries. This time, you may want to focus on that one. There&amp;rsquo;s no one test to rule them all, one workload scenario, so it depends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think there are a few things that I would think about first. What is, like Leandro said, what&amp;rsquo;s the biggest risk? Meaning if there&amp;rsquo;s something where if you don&amp;rsquo;t load test this component there might be security implications, test that. Anything that&amp;rsquo;s critical, like payment or something that might affect compliance regulations for whatever industry it is, meaning like how you handle individuals&amp;rsquo; data, potentially identifiable data, that would be worth load testing. And also anything that&amp;rsquo;s very public, so maybe something like you&amp;rsquo;re about us page is nowhere near as public as your homepage. It can deal your company very significant damage, but hard to quantify damage, in terms of reputation, if your entire homepage is down, rather than if your about us page is down. So that could be a situation where something is not really mission critical or important to the business functionality, but it still would deal a lot of damage. So that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of reputation risk, I guess. A question here not about executors, but we can quickly talk about that. Do we get any performance HTML report in browser k6 load testing? Not yet &amp;lsquo;cause this person specified browser. So I don&amp;rsquo;t think that we have that yet for browser, but there are a few extensions. There&amp;rsquo;s the xk6 dashboard one by Ivan Skiba. And there&amp;rsquo;s also xk6, what is it called, xk6 HTML report or something like that. Go have a look at the session that I just had, the show that I just had with Paul last week, actually, where we talked about this very thing. They&amp;rsquo;re both extensions and they&amp;rsquo;re both awesome. They give like a, the Ivan Skiba one, I think, is the one that you did, Paul, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and actually I was gonna show that a little bit later here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, all right, well let me know when you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might as well jump into that, &amp;lsquo;cause I definitely want to show some things about how to actually implement these workload models in k6. So one way that you can do that is by using scenarios. So I have, let&amp;rsquo;s just start with this one. So I have one script here, it is a protocol level script. And I&amp;rsquo;m just putting it in a separate JavaScript file just so this is a little cleaner to look at, so that we can focus on the scenario. In k6, we have something called scenarios that are ways to set things that run independently of each other. So you can have it be consecutive, or run one before the other, or you can have them run simultaneously. So this one just has, this example that I&amp;rsquo;ve got up now is just one scenario and it has an executor. So let&amp;rsquo;s talk a little bit about executors because this is something that&amp;rsquo;s specific to k6. So let&amp;rsquo;s look here. An executor is basically a way to change the way that the load looks. There are a bunch in k6 and I&amp;rsquo;m actually going to, I already, &amp;lsquo;cause I get this question a lot, I&amp;rsquo;m going to put this in the chat because I have this cheat sheet for how to go about thinking, deciding which one to use. So I&amp;rsquo;m going to post it in the chat and we, I think that the rule of thumb is if you want to just try one, you can, or you want a simple one, it&amp;rsquo;s probably ramping-vus that you want. And that&amp;rsquo;s because this is the default one and a lot of load testing tools where you set the number of virtual users and duration and then sometimes you might have stages. This is also what k6 defaults to. So let&amp;rsquo;s have a look. This is what that looks like. As you can see, I have ramping-vus set here, and this is a way to change the load depending on the number of virtual users. I also have these stages here. The first one is kind of like, I was trying to simulate a ramp up. So from when the test starts, this will start with zero virtual users. I&amp;rsquo;ve got that set here. And then it&amp;rsquo;ll gradually ramp up to 10 over five minutes. This is shorter because I think I was trying to, this was from a demo, so I was trying to make it something that we&amp;rsquo;d actually get results from, but this could be, you know, 30 minutes, if you wanted, depending on your test. And then this is kind of what we call steady state, where the number of virtual users doesn&amp;rsquo;t fluctuate. It&amp;rsquo;s just holding steady for this period of time, in this case 10 minutes. And this last one where it goes from 10 virtual users to zero is reflective of a ramp down. Paul, did you want to share your screen &amp;lsquo;cause I know you said you had some things in cloud to show us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did, yes. And then unfortunately I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to share for my script, there&amp;rsquo;s something going on with my system here. But let me go ahead and share my browser, which is working. So yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is a script that I had done and what I did was, as I was trying to go through and then figure out all these different executors, I wanted to see the pattern that each of these executors applies. So now here, let me, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s better if I start down here. So this is the actual script that I executed. So if you look here, you&amp;rsquo;ll see that in these scenarios and hopefully, let me see if I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Yeah, I was just going to ask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Paul] A little bit more legible, there we go. I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one that may have old eyes and just can&amp;rsquo;t see. So I loaded up the options so that I would have all these different scenarios. &amp;lsquo;Cause I wanted to see every one of these executors and I wanted to be able to see what kind of pattern that they applied. And originally you&amp;rsquo;ll see that some of these numbers are a little bit different, but these are all the very specific things that each one requires. So in this case, the shared iteration scenario, and again, I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna be the expert on what each of these different executors provides, but they&amp;rsquo;re in the docs. So yeah, we can go through there. I&amp;rsquo;m gonna be working on these docs, as well, in the next couple weeks and try to clean these up a little bit more, maybe make &amp;lsquo;em a little bit more, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, state it a little bit differently or to help my understanding anyway. But yeah, so I loaded this up, so I have each one of the different executors set up. So here&amp;rsquo;s the ramping, so similar to what Nicole was talking about with the different durations. So here over a ten-second period, I had it ramp up to, I think, from zero to 10 vus. And then for 10 seconds I would have it keep going at a level 10, so it would be a flat top. And then the last 10 seconds would be ramping down to zero. All these other ones here, too. So, I put every one of these in there so that way then we could go ahead and compare them and, whoa, let me, all right. So each one of these is kind of denoted here and I guess I can&amp;rsquo;t, I wish I could isolate these and then what&amp;rsquo;s really, I guess, the most important here is the purple line and hopefully you&amp;rsquo;re not, no one&amp;rsquo;s really color blind or missing the color differences here. But yeah, so the purple line is the actual number of the request coming through. And then this blue line, or the aqua, is the actual response time for the service. We&amp;rsquo;ll just kind of focus on the purple line that&amp;rsquo;s what these executors are really affecting more so. And then the gray line, this shaded area is actually the virtual users. So you&amp;rsquo;ll see that here it started at zero, and then it ramped up for a period of time, and then it started kind of flattening, and then it would ramp down. Now this is for the accumulation of all the different executors. Unfortunately, and this might be something I might put in as an issue to possibly add or an enhancement is that each one of these lines here is a scenario. So this actually has the shape from that particular executor. So it&amp;rsquo;d be nice to show the vus in here, as well, but you can kind of infer it based on the activity, the request. So again, that&amp;rsquo;s the purple line again. And so here, you see this executor actually ran pretty quickly to get to the number of requests. I was trying to keep them about the same because I wanted to do, like, a progress bar race. So when I was running this locally, I could see the different areas in which was actually completing the same number of requests faster and all that. But yeah, so this was kind of my playing around and, again, this is on the cloud product. So this is an add feature. But now with talking about the HTML reporting, this is what I actually did here. So let me go ahead and I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go ahead and run this script again. Now unfortunately, you&amp;rsquo;re not gonna be able to see the actual execution as I run it locally, but let&amp;rsquo;s see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Paul, we got a question about the k6 cloud results that you were showing. Could you create a shareable link so that people can also have a look at it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Paul] Well, let&amp;rsquo;s see. How can I do that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] You can go to the three dots in the upper right. Yep, and then share test results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Paul] All right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] We can just copy and paste that into the chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Paul] Cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Leandro] And then they are out into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Paul] Out into the world, yeah. Awesome, cool. See, today I learned again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Nicole] Yeah. Awesome. I&amp;rsquo;m so glad you did this, though, because I wanted to, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t get around to doing it. So I&amp;rsquo;m really glad you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Paul] Yeah, and then I wanted to actually have them separate so I could kind of show each one&amp;rsquo;s pattern again. That&amp;rsquo;s the thing that I was really trying to get to, and I&amp;rsquo;ll probably put together a blog post, so keep an eye out for that, where I&amp;rsquo;ll kind of go through that, and describe, and show patterns that are created by the executors. And then that is as I learn more. Again, so this is, this dashboard that I&amp;rsquo;m showing here, this is actually an extension. So I did compile this into the k6 binary, custom with this output. And this is available here. This is this xk6 dashboard, and this is also included in our registry on the site, so you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to find this as well. Pretty easy to do this, the xk6, to create the extension and build it. But anyway, we can always give help. Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go ahead in this other window, and I&amp;rsquo;m gonna go ahead and start this test running. So now as we see here, and I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to refresh, but let&amp;rsquo;s see, go ahead and refresh here. All right. So now this test is running in the background. And then we should start seeing the output. There we go. Now, there is a delay. So behind the scenes, this is actually using, it&amp;rsquo;s creating Prometheus-based metrics and then it&amp;rsquo;s serving that up in a little web server locally. So it&amp;rsquo;s really cool. So I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to play around with it nearly as much as I need to, but anyway, but this is something, it&amp;rsquo;s a nice little tool to be able to use if you don&amp;rsquo;t want just the plain text display in your console. But yeah, so this test is actually already completed. Now, it&amp;rsquo;s actually still running in a way, though, because we have this externally controlled executor where now from another terminal I could sit there and I could say, okay, yeah, now I wanna ramp up the vus to 10 or that type of a thing, just via rest API. But unfortunately, due to technical difficulties, I can&amp;rsquo;t show you that, but I will definitely put that in the blog post when I start putting that together. Anyway, this is one of those cool little tools with this extension that you can kind of, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, really get some cool results. But yeah, that was the big thing. Here&amp;rsquo;s for the external access, this is the rest API where I could sit there and call that custom executor and say pause testing or even to ramp up the number of vus. Still figuring this out a little bit. It&amp;rsquo;s a little, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, it needs some play around with it a little bit to get a good understanding of it. But yeah, I wanted to show that, again, you can do this stuff, have the graphics there. Now, the HTML report that Nicole was talking about, that&amp;rsquo;s something where, yeah, you could save that off, and again, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the graphics, I don&amp;rsquo;t think, if I remember correctly, but it does have it where you could then save that off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not real time either. But it is more like a report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, yeah. That&amp;rsquo;s it, let me go ahead and stop that test. Oh yeah. So again, I will put together something so that way then if anybody wants these details and obviously you can use that link, so it&amp;rsquo;s now shareable, so I will make sure to not delete it .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great. I do want to share something, Paul, if you&amp;rsquo;re okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great. So I also wanted to talk about the fact that we can do it, you can put together a scenario using different executors, but another thing that you could do is have each scenario be a completely different test. One could be a load test. Another could be a chaos engineering test, for instance. Like this is one that I had where this get Pokemon is an HTTP request that just hits the API. And this is intended to be more of a load test, but then you could have a chaos scenario and you can say that at a certain point, you fire off this thing that then terminates one of the pods in Kubernetes, according to certain conditions. This is using the xk6-chaos extension. But in this way, you can see that these are not just load-testing scenarios. These are just testing scenarios and they&amp;rsquo;re different types of testing that you could use. Another type other than chaos is browser testing now that we&amp;rsquo;ve got xk6 browser. So now you can do things where you have one scenario that&amp;rsquo;s doing some sort of protocol level test and the other one is doing a browser level test. And because those two are fundamentally different, you may want to be able to control them separately. You probably won&amp;rsquo;t be wanting to generate majority of the load with a browser level test, for instance, you probably wanna do that with your protocol level test, but you might want to piggyback off of the protocol test and run a few, like a handful, of browser users just to be able to get some front-end metrics. So, I think it&amp;rsquo;s kind of cool that you can do that. Another thing that you can do with scenarios and executors, well, it&amp;rsquo;s something with workload modeling anyway for k6, this is a script that I&amp;rsquo;ve got for percentages. Now, I think the use case for this, I mean, there are a lot of use cases, but what I actually think this could be used for is an e-commerce scenario where a typical scenario is to have like 100% of the virtual users go into your homepage, and then maybe 50% of them go and browse through the product pages, and then of that 50%, maybe only half of those actually added to the cart. So that is also something that isn&amp;rsquo;t directly related to scenarios and executors, but it does have something to do with the workload model of your test. So in this example, I&amp;rsquo;m setting a random number between one and 100, and then depending on that, I have this combination, in this case, I&amp;rsquo;m setting different clients for it. So let&amp;rsquo;s say that there&amp;rsquo;s a really big client that we want to use 50% of the time, you could use that, and then pass that on to some request that you&amp;rsquo;re sending. And in this way, you&amp;rsquo;re already making something that&amp;rsquo;s more realistic than just get a client, just get details for a client. Well, which client is that because maybe that&amp;rsquo;s being cached? Maybe you do want it to be cached, you&amp;rsquo;d have to see what you want, what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to achieve with that particular test, but it all has an impact on your testing results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and if I may add for learning some of these functionalities, it makes, and I think I started a comment how the situations, how the ramp-ups work, how when we want to model these targets in the old days, as I said, getting these, okay, my user takes this amount of time of execution, it has this amount of random timers, and it&amp;rsquo;s a pain at times when your process starts to degrade a little bit of performance, and because of that, they don&amp;rsquo;t go as fast as you need them to, as you want to generate, because you did the calculations based on optimal response times, right. So some of these controls will be very useful depending on the scenario that you are wanting to focus and not to do all that type of crazy math that we had to do. I remember with the load runner days, it was like, okay, but if the response time starts to deviate a little bit, this we need to, there&amp;rsquo;s so much that on this situation with some of these options, k6 can mutate may be the wrong word, but adapt to what you&amp;rsquo;re trying to do, right, and keep doing the loads and doing those processes that you are aimed for. There are some others that you are like, if the system starts to go slow, the users will slow down and that&amp;rsquo;s right, that&amp;rsquo;s okay, that&amp;rsquo;s normal, but on others it&amp;rsquo;s like, no, I absolutely want that the users keep coming, keeps hearing the system, even if the system is slowing or many other things that can start to happen. These controls truly make our lives easier. in so many of those situations like crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a question from SJ who says, is there a pacing config in k6 or maybe a throughput controller equivalent? So let&amp;rsquo;s talk about pacing, Pacing and load testing terms is related to think time in that it does impose some sort of timing on the requests, but while a think time is more like a direct sleep on a thread, pacing is more like the space between each iteration and there are different ways to achieve this. k6 doesn&amp;rsquo;t have something that is exactly pacing. But for instance, the way that JMeter would do this is by using the throughput controller, which is what I think SJ is alluding to. And so instead of specifying the time between each iteration, JMeter does it by allowing you to set a target request per second, some sort of throughput. And we do have that. Let me just share my screen again. So this is the executors that we have. And I think this constant arrival rate would be the best for that. Because if we look at the example here, you can set a rate here, a requests per second, that is your target. What k6 does is it sends a request or it does one iteration, sees how many requests were sent, and then adjusts the next one, waits a certain time so that before it does the next iteration to adjust to that. So if it already did, you know, 200 requests per second the first iteration, then maybe it&amp;rsquo;ll just do the same thing for the second iteration. And it will dynamically change throughout the test. So maybe at the beginning of the test, response times are faster because not all the users have ramped up yet. In that case, the pacing might be slower because there&amp;rsquo;s no delay on the server side. And so the script is easily hitting the 200 requests per second, but you&amp;rsquo;ll find that later on throughout the test, you may experience higher response times, and in that case, the pacing will be quicker. So that number will be lower so that it still reaches the 200 requests per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s part of what I was mentioning that easiness of. JMeter, I remember before they didn&amp;rsquo;t have that plugin for the throughput, what was the name, I just forgot about it. At the very first times that we started to use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughput controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughput controller, thank you. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have those type of controllers, ways to managing them. And again, bringing the load runner days, I don&amp;rsquo;t remember many useful devices to go through this. And on this case, when you have a scenario that at times when we were designing this workflow, this scenario, we would know, okay, I know that per user, I want that in an hour these many iterations happen. So if you want that, you can use the per vu iterations executor that will help you to quickly configure and manage that, you do have the iterations per user, and maybe you have 10 users, 20 users, you don&amp;rsquo;t care about the number of users. Then you select the shared iterations. I just need this throughput to happen this number of times in this period of time, maybe next time I will have more virtual users, maybe next time I will have less. So you have more control on the end game, to call it in a way, that you&amp;rsquo;re looking for, rather than, and I cannot say this enough, it was a struggle to try to control, and simulate, and reach those goals that you were trying to get in your simulation, and there are so many reasons, as I said, the wait times in between steps were randomized before, as Nicole says, you have the pacing times in between each cycle, and it was so many, like three factors, main factors, I would say, wait time, pacing time, and processing time, each step would add up to that time that there are so many variables that were somewhat random that you could not control. So here you would have some assistance, some help on hitting those goals that you&amp;rsquo;re trying to simulate and having it realistic or on the goal that you&amp;rsquo;re trying to reach, right. It&amp;rsquo;s that difference, I don&amp;rsquo;t know if anyone has gym experience or has ever visited one of those things, but they will tell you, hey, I want to work leg today. Okay, do five repetitions three times. That&amp;rsquo;s if you wanna think of that, how long do you take and do each sit up to go, to give an example, that will be your think time, your wait time in between steps. Okay, you need some rest time before you do the next one. That&amp;rsquo;s the pacing. So for the ones that are not so familiar with those terms, just wanted to throw out that silly example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s one of those things I&amp;rsquo;d like to, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I keep thinking of playing around with, you know, if you look at say HTTP audit logs or something like that, they have a timestamp on there as far as when everything came in. Well, if you take that and use that as the basis to basically replay your activity, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, that&amp;rsquo;s one of the things that I keep thinking about, that would be cool to do, or to have, you know, all your activity going into Kafka, and then being able to repeatedly replay the exact same, perfect storm scenario without having the randomness injected in there. I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I&amp;rsquo;m probably going off on a tangent, but that immediately made me think of that, though. It&amp;rsquo;s like this is one of those things where it&amp;rsquo;s like I always kinda wanna play around with this idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that there&amp;rsquo;s a time for that. I think there&amp;rsquo;s a use case for it, but there are also some disadvantages, I think. that people should be aware of. If it&amp;rsquo;s information from a production environment, there are potentially security concerns there for using a user&amp;rsquo;s data to test or a user&amp;rsquo;s account to test. And what happens if that actually gets replayed on their account, which it could be, it, it might not be. Sometimes it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work, sometimes sending the same request, even if it&amp;rsquo;s exactly the same, won&amp;rsquo;t work. I think that that&amp;rsquo;s, I think, more experimental, I guess, when you don&amp;rsquo;t really know what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for and you&amp;rsquo;re trying to narrow it down, but I also think that once you&amp;rsquo;ve narrowed it down, it&amp;rsquo;s probably easier and cleaner to script it up so that you can consistently reproduce that scenario. And you can also use test data. Also, you&amp;rsquo;d be able to kind of break it down, you&amp;rsquo;d control all the variables, so you know with certainty that when there&amp;rsquo;s only one thing that changed and it was a negative result, then you know that that was the cause of it. But yeah, I think that there&amp;rsquo;s a valid reason to use that, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, there&amp;rsquo;s definitely data sanitization that you gotta be concerned about unless we&amp;rsquo;re replaying activity on Leandro&amp;rsquo;s credit card, then it&amp;rsquo;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, please don&amp;rsquo;t. Oops, there are 10,000 charges per hour in your credit card. What?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing your credit card. Navin Kumar, whose videos I was just plugging at the start of this has a question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very good question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can we intentionally include sleep time in the response time? Now, Mihail, who&amp;rsquo;s one of our developers, if I say something wrong, tell me in the comments, but I believe that there isn&amp;rsquo;t a way, that there&amp;rsquo;s no k6 specific function to do this or option. What I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of is you could create a custom metric because you can create really a bunch of different metrics, counters, and timers, and gauges, and whatever in k6. So you could definitely do that and have that reported and you could set the timing manually, as well. Another thing that I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of is if I had to do this, I&amp;rsquo;d probably just use the xk6 browser extension, because that&amp;rsquo;s already going to include everything, the actual render time. &amp;lsquo;Cause now we&amp;rsquo;re getting, if you&amp;rsquo;re including the sleep time or the think time, this is more like getting into the front-end performance side of things and I think it might just be easier to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was gonna be kind of a question that I wanted to do, too, Naveen. Like why do you want to include the sleep time programmatically that you are generating in your script? I mean, as you say, Nicole, the front end is important to know those render times, those wasted moments in the response or back-and-forth communication, but what are you trying to use it for? It would be very interesting if you can share it. I&amp;rsquo;m curious what&amp;rsquo;s the use. Oh, okay, you were just being creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I think that, yeah, probably if you want to just see front-end experience, I do think it would be more useful if in this case, if you&amp;rsquo;re including it in the response time, then maybe have a constant sleep, actually, because then it&amp;rsquo;s consistent because you don&amp;rsquo;t want the sleep to be influencing your results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did use something like that a long time ago, but precisely to model this workload to calculate. I generally recommend do a small-ish version of the load test that you want to do, let it run for a while so that you can massage those values of how much random time to sleep here, how much random pacing you have here, and how is the response time affected so that you can balance it out. That could be an interesting use, real-life example, but that&amp;rsquo;s a good question, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, injecting a network latency and things like that is always a nice thing for backend services. I mean, with microservices, because one single API call on the front end could be going through 10 different microservices ultimately. And to be able to test something where if halfway through those calls if you have a network hiccup where one of the services is not accessible, but it&amp;rsquo;s, anyway, but it&amp;rsquo;s all one of those things where it&amp;rsquo;s like this feels a little bit more on the chaos engineering aspect of things, you know, how is your application going to behave when something goes wrong? If all of a sudden your network grinds to a halt where it&amp;rsquo;s going really slow, is your application handling that scenario appropriately?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, and on that note, we are actually a little bit over on time already, that went by really quickly. Thank you both for coming and for sharing your thoughts on these topics and also for demoing the k6 cloud stuff that you already had, Paul. Yeah, you are welcome back anytime and I hope we do this again. And for everybody,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought that was the last one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, well, sorry to disappoint you. You&amp;rsquo;re stuck now, like you&amp;rsquo;ve signed the contract, that was it. You didn&amp;rsquo;t read the fine print. Must come to office hours every Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would be the last time that you would want me on here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for those of you who are watching, thank you for watching. Thank you for all the awesome questions we got this week and have a good weekend. And if you are in a place where it&amp;rsquo;s very stormy, good luck, hope we all survive it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bye everyone, have a good weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take care everyone, adios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week for k6 Office Hours, I talked to one of the newest members on our team, &lt;a href=&#34;https://srperf.com&#34;&gt;Leandro Melendez, aka Señor Performo&lt;/a&gt;, about his experience in joining k6/Grafana Labs. We ended up talking about performance &amp;ldquo;deadly sins&amp;rdquo; and how the practice of performance engineering has changed in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, my former colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simon Aronsson&lt;/a&gt; brought his &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; colleague, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mmanciop&#34;&gt;Michele Mancioppi&lt;/a&gt;, to k6 Office Hours to talk about observability, and how they do it at &lt;a href=&#34;https://canonical.com&#34;&gt;Canonical&lt;/a&gt;. It turned into a great conversation about trends in observability from the last decade, and how it relates to performance and reliability testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;transcript&#34;&gt;Transcript&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone, and welcome back to the first k6 Office Hours of the year. Happy 2022, I&amp;rsquo;m Nicole Vander Hoeven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;m Simme, we&amp;rsquo;re back from the dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;m Michele.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simme is back. Yes, so Simme unfortunately is only temporarily back, and he&amp;rsquo;s brought his new colleague. I mean, I&amp;rsquo;m kind of sad, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to meet you Michele Manciopi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome. Simme why don&amp;rsquo;t you first tell everybody, how you betrayed us at k6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry for that, was a couple of months ago now. I think I quit at k6 in October, beginning of October something like that, to join Canonical and Michele, where we are trying to build a really awesome observability stack to know little part built on top of Grafana products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it has been a very interesting three months. It&amp;rsquo;s actually a pretty refreshing to be able to use high quality software and compose it in ways that are, you know, they just work through, cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we already have a few people in the peanut gallery, there&amp;rsquo;s Simme and Michele and our newest colleague, I think senior performer, all saying hi to you Simme. so you&amp;rsquo;re very much missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to k6 for bringing Leandra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely, and by the way, Leandra will be on k6 Office Hours next week, he just accepted the invite. So when I&amp;rsquo;m letting him like relax, and do his bootcamp onboarding things, and his week of load testing this week. . Ooh Danielle is here as well. Michele, why don&amp;rsquo;t you talk about yourself, and what you do at Canonical?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I am a product manager at Canonical, for observer BD team. I was brought in with the goal of making the entirety of the product line of Canonical observable. Canonical is chiefly known for Ubuntu, but we have like a meter other products and they all need to be observable because they all sit at different levels of critical pieces of the infrastructure. Before Canonical, I was the technical product manager at Instana, which has been what baby ham it&amp;rsquo;s a product that does very automated observability. It&amp;rsquo;s mostly proprietary, but it was a lot of fun trying to make observability the way it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be. That is seamless. Very easy to roll out. Before that I was at SAP where I was the technical lead of the performance team for SAP cloud platform, where my job was mostly to figure out where things were slow and fix it. And then I realized that rather than helping one single developer at the time, would they be more productive in actually providing pretty decent tools to do that at scale so people could do it themselves, which then brought me down the path of figuring out it&amp;rsquo;s actually fun here to make an observability product than it is to using one. And then the CircleCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Simme what was it about Canonical that won you over?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I actually think it was to no little part Michele won me over with his argumentation for&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay. I&amp;rsquo;m taking him off the stream sorry. No, no, No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Cause I got you everyone, bye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. We&amp;rsquo;re still all friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do really miss the k6 family for sure. But yeah, it was just such a cool and exciting opportunity to be able to make this huge leap in observability with Canonical, for such a vastly used project or suite of tools and products. So that&amp;rsquo;s mainly one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. Can we stop to remark? That was the coolest cup I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in a long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is as if this is sponsored, this is a hydrate spark, it&amp;rsquo;s a smart water bottle. And it&amp;rsquo;s marketed like for people like me because it&amp;rsquo;s a water bottle, but it has Bluetooth and LED light. So, you know, obviously I had to buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, just out of curiosity, what are the key values of the Bluetooth support?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, it tells me when I need to drink water. It&amp;rsquo;s very important stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you monitor that A, the Bluetooth is working and how do you receive those notifications?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s funny that you ask, there is an app for it. This is totally not sponsored. Okay. But there is an app for it. I was gonna say Simme that it seems like there was a slight change in your focus as well, because at k6, we&amp;rsquo;re more focused on the performance and reliability testing part of it. But definitely we&amp;rsquo;ve also dabbled in the observability space, especially with the acquisition of Grafana. So it seems like your new role is also more focused towards observability. Was that one of the considerations?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure it is. And then that was definitely one of the considerations during my, what is it now? 12 or something years in tech, I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing way more observability and monitoring work than I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing performance testing. And so that definitely felt like coming home in a sense to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I wanna ask you both this because you&amp;rsquo;ve both been in observability for awhile. How do you think observability and performance testing go together? Do you see them as separate disciplines entirely, there&amp;rsquo;s clearly some sort of overlap, right? Should companies be doing both, one or the other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely think there is a lot of overlap. One thing that I know that you and I have been pushing forward when we&amp;rsquo;ve been discussing this previously on the stream is that performance testing is great, but it usually only allows you to do a black box perspective testing, right? You&amp;rsquo;re able to measure the performance of your system, given certain interfaces or end points that you are able to observe the performance off and pairing that with observability tools, like for instance, loci or tempo, or Prometheus&amp;rsquo;s allows you to really drill back into the stack and figure out what is causing those problems. So I definitely think that it makes sense to combine the both to be able to observe the whole system and not just the edges of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you agree with that Michele?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, very much, over go and say that actually, it&amp;rsquo;s very hard to draw a demarkation between the performance and of observability, especially since in the last few decades and the increasingly disproportionately larger role that internet and internet systems taking our lives. We have come to see, you know, slow as the new down, which means that not only the software needs to work but it needs to be fast. And if you observability is fundamentally the art of understanding, are there problems? I mean, so how bad was impacted and how badly, and that is both in terms of software, it is broken as software is luck. Many of the techniques that you would use in, for example, a QA system to check the scalability of your software is something that you can use at scale in production to make sure that you&amp;rsquo;re at least carrying that much load, as well as techniques for example, for performance testing, you often do a lot of black box monitoring. The techniques that you use to check if today in SIL on a mobile connection, your web store is reachable is very similar in terms of technologies and capabilities and as technical requirements. So the technology is there to use, to throw a lot of requests security to your software. So it&amp;rsquo;s fundamentally the performance tools are versatile like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I totally agree with that. I have always taken the stance that it&amp;rsquo;s definitely better when you have both of them because observability is great. But then in pre-production environments, it can be a little tricky &amp;lsquo;cause you don&amp;rsquo;t have real traffic and that&amp;rsquo;s where performance testing can come in handy and performance testing is great, but you don&amp;rsquo;t always want to run it in production. And also you, it&amp;rsquo;s not always a good idea to be reliant on the results of the performance testing tool. You know, sometimes it makes a lot more sense to be already using the same observability stack that you use in production. And I also want to call out that performance testing is often thought of as load testing, but that&amp;rsquo;s really just one kind of performance that is being measured there. And so what about a related topic to observability as monitoring? I know Michele, you have a lot to say on that topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh my, can I rant?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Go ahead. I&amp;rsquo;m familiar with your blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ooh influence. I have a &amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do research, you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought you came across it because, you know, super rabid spike. No, the, so I have been around the observability industry for awhile and I have a certain annoyance towards what the industry has done by rebranding perfectly good monitoring and application performance tools in terms of the hot new term up observability that you need to sell to sort of the software. The way I see it&amp;rsquo;s a much more formal, shall we say way. Observability is a property that you want your systems to have, monitoring is the way that we have to make most systems observable. However, something that I hope we will see in our lifetime, our software systems and such a level of quality and standardization in our profession of creating software systems. So that monitoring and observability becomes build team in the softwares we create. If you think about it all the for example, automatic distributed tracing and all the amazing innovations that have occurred over the past 15 years are effectively reckoning the lack of observability as a functional requirement of a piece of software. Monitoring is the art to collecting data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, and I think that there&amp;rsquo;s also a connotation of monitoring being a bit more passive. Would you agree with that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily, no. At the end of it so there is, I really take the view that monitoring is a means to the end of observability. It is true that in the past few years, with new generations of tools, we have made leaps and bounds in both the capability of collecting useful telemetry with very little work in terms of toil to roll it out, without the proper tools are there and I used to work for one where you deploy an agent and it automatically discovers all around it. There is a lot of dark magic going on, but it works. And then it becomes very cheap to actually get to the holy grail of monitoring that is to have as little silos as possible. Telemetry wants to have friends. You want to see end to end systems how they relate to one another. Now, the moment that something that has changed recently in the industry is we have gotten better, not only at collecting telemetry, but analyzing it. When you compare monitoring tools that we started with right there the Nagios of the world. You&amp;rsquo;ll need it to know in advance what you were looking for. Now with broader collection of telemetry, for example, distributed tracing, a very powerful type of telemetry, very little underutilized in terms of the insights can provide you, you end up having a lot of data that is likely going to be useful, and you have much more freedom in how you analyze it, both in terms of discovering issues as they occur, as well as afterwards in terms of post-mortem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do have, however one, I agree with you completely Michele. I do however, think Nicole has a point in that if you look at the traditional monitoring tools that people used to use, like Nagios for instance, it was always this very weird situation where you put up SNMP traps or collected, you know, logs that were thrown at you in a very passive manner. But I would say that it turned monitoring itself has come to evolve into a state where it very much is an active practice in the same way as people would describe observability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh. So you are making a very interesting distinction of rather than receiving as a data sync telemetry that was emitted, but something else that you go and get it through RTI, things like deploying an agent that does stuff. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. Or for instance, actually triggering a synthetic test that just prompts a common user flow and make sure that that still works. I mean, as compared to just admitting this passive telemetry data that just keeps rolling on, but maybe lacks the context as you put it on more advanced workflows where you&amp;rsquo;d correlate multiple sources of data or the multiple actions to derive your data that you want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is true that in the past 15, 20 years, there has been an increase of active monitoring. I remember doing it back in the day with smoke tests that were of a crunch up every 15 minutes. I was so young. And now it&amp;rsquo;s that it&amp;rsquo;s kind of a baseline of observability. I mean, you need to want to catch everything, but if there is catastrophic failure, you will know hopefully before someone starts opening tickets or you&amp;rsquo;re upping your drops. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. I think Simme it was right when he was saying, what I was talking about was like the more traditional approach that it&amp;rsquo;s just something that&amp;rsquo;s there in the background whereas these days, the way that it should be done is a lot more proactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also they focus on actually gathering telemetry to be able to detect failure modes rather than probing for a certain thing. It used to be much more focused on a single point that you would probe for data. And&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It used to have simpler software too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sure did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure. But I also wanted to say that there&amp;rsquo;s also been, there&amp;rsquo;s still some push based monitoring, but we&amp;rsquo;re also now seeing more poll based monitoring systems, more event driven ones. And I think this is all the evolution of monitoring and observability, right? Because these things did not exist not too long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be fair, the one should, it is pretty true. We have much more pool and pool length. This is something that a permit use has pretty much popularized with the concept of scraping, but there are entire domains where we deploy a software that is still very much push based. For example, IOT, for very basic reasons of network visibility, it&amp;rsquo;s very hard to go and reach out into someone else&amp;rsquo;s rooftop and go get the data. So there is still the mechanics of push buffer and pulled it for example, gave us in the primitive ecosystem, push gateway mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grafana agent that actually sits in between you and a cloud service or something else, and allows you to not punch holes in your firewall, but rather reach out and deliver data to something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of like you mentioned that our applications in general are just getting more and more complex, it reminds me the push the trend from monolith to microservices and then now some people are also going back. It&amp;rsquo;s never really gone, right. And it&amp;rsquo;s really difficult to say, no, this is the new way, nobody else is doing or should do the other way. It&amp;rsquo;s not really like that. A lot of things in tech are cyclical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I actually spoke about our systems are getting more complex. I was thinking exactly of micro services because we made a trade as an industry for very, very simple, very small components. And then pushing all the complexity that you cannot make disappear under the carpet of service meshes, many containers, things that need to be versioned independently remain compatible, which is actually one of the main drivers why in the observability industry, we moved from the very traditional, I don&amp;rsquo;t like the word pillars, but the very traditional telemetry types of logs and metrics with the occasional sprinkling of profiling to rather extensive use of distributed tracing because all of a sudden the problem was less often in the single simpler components and much more often in between.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this is kind of a funny conversation to me &amp;lsquo;cause I don&amp;rsquo;t know if you remember, but 10 years ago we used to talk about microservices as well, but then we called it service-oriented architecture and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t the new cool thing. And then we decided that that was kind of cumbersome and powerful to work with. And we started to merge together our software, again, introduced monoliths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a service record architecture, we tended to have a very expensive, very large piece of machinery called the enterprise service bus that actually was providing to some extent that kind of visibility that today we need to have through tracing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let&amp;rsquo;s also not discount the effect of the proliferation of cloud providers, because when you have your own data center and your audiences, maybe your internal company or something, maybe it is a good thing to go from one huge complex monolith to three simpler services. But when it&amp;rsquo;s not three, it&amp;rsquo;s like hundreds, maybe then you start needing like another layer to orchestrate and manage and all of the traffic between each of those components. It&amp;rsquo;s definitely not that clear cut to say which one is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely think you&amp;rsquo;re bang on in that case, Nicole, &amp;lsquo;cause we&amp;rsquo;ve moved from maybe having a couple of software devs for a company that did some kind of HTML that website with some access database backend in the worst cases, right? We now have these huge teams of hundreds of developers that are all working on a compost system together. And having that as a monolith would in practice require us to either do these huge orchestrations of release trains that no one is able to do in a proficient fashion. Or we would have to have downtime all the time &amp;lsquo;cause we would need to redeploy everything every time we made a change. So in that sense, it really makes sense to split it up as we grow our teams and we grow our development efforts as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a rather, so coming from a very enterprise background I have a rather newest feel to be on the subject. And my take is that usually technological problems are not technological problems, there are people problems. One of the main motivators that was towards going to the extreme distribution of microservices. &amp;lsquo;Cause I tried to fight back against the Conway&amp;rsquo;s law. The fact that roughly the architecture of your system mirrored the architecture of your organization. So we said, look, we have all these teams, these pizza teams, it&amp;rsquo;s very hard to make them cooperate to create a well-behaved monolith. So let&amp;rsquo;s give each of them their independent infrastructure and talk over standardize protocols like most of the HTTP and some sort of RPC built on top of it. And that would provide for them a way to be productive independent of each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an industry, we dramatically underestimated the cost and complexity that comes from the need of coordination and compatibility and understanding among these teams, because now you no longer have one code base that you can run tests against. You have to have multiple ones that may interact surprisingly at Atlanta. These for example, has led to introduction of contract based testing, where teams contribute to each other interface tests. And there&amp;rsquo;s also the saying, which is something that is a harsh reality that every observable behavior of an application with a large enough user base, will become a dependency for somebody somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is the whole premise of Conway&amp;rsquo;s law, right? The idea that our architect, the software architecture or the infrastructure that we put into place in a lot of ways starts to evolve depending on how our team is structured. And I think it&amp;rsquo;s both a technological and a human problem as well. When you talk about coordination between teams or between services, it&amp;rsquo;s really the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. We have made actually strides in how easy it is to make software inter operate with each other. If you go back, we started, we were talking about SOA. SOA came with a curse called SOAP. It was incredibly complicated, mindbogglingly hard to make run at scale. Today, we have a bunch of, so we are using HTP for other things. Sometimes I would think too many, we have good stuff like GRPC, like arrow, a lot of different protocols that can be very efficiently used to either make a synchronous message passing happen or synchronous invocations. We have a lot of tools that in the past year and half, I think we&amp;rsquo;ve got the big two trigger happy in deploying a lot of new tools in production. And I&amp;rsquo;m saying this with a background of someone that fundamentally had to support every single piece of technology that made input or output, for example, on Java. It would surprise you how many different HTTP clients for Java are I think in production, I lost count. There were 50, it&amp;rsquo;s insane. And I&amp;rsquo;m, for example, you raised your mark right with a very, very beautiful LED and Bluetooth. And it&amp;rsquo;s super cool. I feel&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was trying to share something that Simme was sharing there, but I can&amp;rsquo;t actually see it for some reason. Oh, there it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s this Simme?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love to say, I like to bring out this picture whenever we talk about why observability is needed. &amp;lsquo;Cause while it&amp;rsquo;s a lot larger than most of us operate with, and it&amp;rsquo;s still very striking that they think this is supposed to be Netflix&amp;rsquo;s is a microservice architecture at some point, whether it is or not, I don&amp;rsquo;t really know, but it&amp;rsquo;s supposed to be and trying to&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can I be trashy? Can I be able to trashy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Architecture has an element of deliberation that they do not believe there&amp;rsquo;s an actual out of the system has, this is an emergent system is a lot of architectures that then meshed into something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s remarkable that it works so well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. And one of the cool things there, I think is the fact that without observability where this big ball of yarn, it would be completely unfeasible to reason about anything this system is doing at scale. You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to reason about the particular part, maybe that you are working on one of these small dots that we can&amp;rsquo;t even see because of all the lines. But to reason about what it does is as a whole would be completely unreasonable. But with tools like, for instance, distributed tracing, we&amp;rsquo;re suddenly able to follow end to end an action of a user or an agent within this system. That was all I wanted to think of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love distributed systems, distributed tracing in distributed systems, because it actually gives you the means of answering the most important question or you&amp;rsquo;re faced with an issue, who is affected and how badly? When you go on an enterprise setting and our people are often databases service, your application completely blowing up, could be a drop in the bucket of their system. They will not probably have the central entry you have to have a very different take on priorities unless you have agreed upon a slice on the silos and the failure that you are fundamentally up streaming through your users may not be their concern, but the moment you have the shooting tracing, that goes from the deepest database to the device in the face of your user, yet you have a very clear perception of how bad is something that is the one most important piece of information that you need in front of your face when the pager goes off again at 3:00 AM, you need to decide whether it&amp;rsquo;s time to go on to Batman, or if it can wait until the third coffee tomorrow morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that&amp;rsquo;s the real success of the &amp;ldquo;Squid Game&amp;rdquo; right? Because that image that you had up Simme, and just imagine that times 114 million users that are potentially using many of those systems, it&amp;rsquo;s amazing that it works at all at that scale, especially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something that always gives me those thoughtful moments of, oh my God, what are we doing as an industry? Is that a potentially simple issues have disproportionate impact on popular services to the life of many, many people. It goes from lack of entertainment. You&amp;rsquo;re there you want to see the latest, &amp;ldquo;Witcher&amp;rdquo; episode, cool stuff. You&amp;rsquo;re disappointed if the thing is on top, multiply that by a medium people that cannot get there, there are fix, Hey, you have a significant amount of life around that has gotten worse, but it goes also to something that is maybe much more limited, but much more tragic. For example, when I was working at SAP, one of our customers was, I cannot say the country, but it was the first aid response service of one of the countries. We were scared plus that something so important that either the platform, because downtime would have consistent consequences to real people, something that we have seen recently with the move to the cloud and the disproportionate role that for example, U.S system one has on everybody&amp;rsquo;s life today. We have seen how the risk is getting more and more concentrated into fewer and fewer, very large, very complex, very reliable, but critical pieces of infrastructure, in ways that I do not believe as a society we have had yet. And that is where it really humbles me as an engineer to think, well, this has to work, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. We went through that in, I think in the last k6 Office Hours, I had somebody from oil funk, who is an emergency services provider in Austria, and it was cool, but also a little scary to find out that they are using k6 for, in part to also handle the traffic from the 112 emergency hotline. So it&amp;rsquo;s cool to see something that you&amp;rsquo;re working on, be used in such a critical industry, right. But at the same time, it&amp;rsquo;s also a little scary because it could actually be lives that are lost if you know, we don&amp;rsquo;t do our jobs well enough, it&amp;rsquo;s a little humbling to think of that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess the closest resemblance we&amp;rsquo;ve had to these critical infrastructures that everyone relies on would it be like the transatlantic Telegraph cable? I mean, that has like in, I think it&amp;rsquo;s currently 19 cables or something like that, that make up the transatlantic telephone cable. But I really any catastrophic failure there would really isolate us in terms of cross continental communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that is less likely to result in loss of life. Then, for example, your neighbor want service, not being able to follow you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for having completely spoiled the mood. I think that as an industry, we need to go in deserve the role of engineers. If we built bridges the way we push software to production, in some cases, I don&amp;rsquo;t think anybody would cross a river without crossing themselves first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s interesting is in that spaghetti soup of microservices that you showed Simme, now we&amp;rsquo;re seeing that our observability stack is part of those. They are also contributing back to the system that we have to monitor. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if either of you saw the post-mortem by roadblocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was classic. I had ops to them. It&amp;rsquo;s a, we have all been there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes yes. Do you have to talk about it Michele?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do, but I don&amp;rsquo;t think I would be able to be nearly as good as a Simme for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just came to be honest. So I don&amp;rsquo;t have any detail commentary on that either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the classic fallacy of oh jolly, oh golly. The same infrastructure that is powering my observability system was probably the system that went down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right. All right. Yeah, that really is something that you&amp;rsquo;ll see a lot. I mean, for instance, say that you have a deployment of the classic Grafana suite somewhere, and you have that running in the same data cluster maybe, or at least the same cloud provider as you have your critical workloads and to make it even worse, you could go down to having it in the same geographic region, or even on the same cluster nodes or the same hardware that you&amp;rsquo;re using for the rest of your critical infrastructure. When something goes south there, in terms of your critical infrastructure, it is likely that that was all will also, as I think, where to kick would roadblock, spill over to your monitoring system. And if that happens, how are you gonna be able to tell that you&amp;rsquo;ve been hit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the classic blast radius question. Everything has failure modes, actually, several of them, and the more abstractions we deploy, the more failure modes we introduce, for example, Simme and I are building an observability system based on Kubernetes natives. Our guidance is if you deployed, deployed to a different cluster on different hardware, because you should never put the monitoring system on the same infrastructure, close to the infrastructure stuff we monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not only that. We also usually recommend that if you deploy our monitoring system, deploy another monitoring system that makes sure that your monitoring system is up and set them up in a, what did they call it? That dead mans trigger?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dead man switch is the idea that, for example, do you know in the movies when the hero goes in front of him and says, if you kill me, you will be exposed in two days time. That&amp;rsquo;s the classic deadness which is something that happens unless someone periodically goes there and tells him not to. In this case, in the case of monitoring is unless your system, your monitoring system is telling you that it&amp;rsquo;s fine, assume tragedy. It never goes to the level of a specific use cases, but first of all, you need, let me take a step back. The best monitoring system is the one that tells you whether it&amp;rsquo;s something to look at, right? You actually do not want to have dashboards, however, colorful and beautiful in front of your face all the time, unless it is for Ferguson purposes, you actually want to be able to focus on something else and jump into the action when stuff is hitting the fan. In order to do that, you must have the guarantee that is the easy model of notification. You will receive it because silence, you want to know that it means that it&amp;rsquo;s good. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to doubt if there is something going on that my sister should tell me but doesn&amp;rsquo;t, which is why you set up fundamentally a health check thing that says I&amp;rsquo;m thinking here and all it&amp;rsquo;s fine. That is the diagnose switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found it so interesting to read through the post-mortem and props to them too, by the way, for releasing something so detailed, they were not afraid to, you know, say what they&amp;rsquo;d done wrong and what they were doing to address it. I thought it was really well-written, but I want to read one part of it, because I thought it was so good. They said, &amp;ldquo;There was a circular dependency between our telemetry systems and console, which meant that when console was unhealthy, we lacked the telemetry data that would have made it easier for us to figure out what was wrong. We&amp;rsquo;ve removed the circular independency, our telemetry systems no longer depend on the systems they&amp;rsquo;re configured to monitor.&amp;rdquo; I thought that was a great takeaway from that whole incident. And because they&amp;rsquo;ve shared it in the post-mortem, they&amp;rsquo;re not the only ones who can learn from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very generous of them to expose themselves that way and actually left the rest of the industry learn from their mistakes. And so hard work as you said, Michele, our love to the team at the roadblocks who probably need needed a bit of time out after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is also another component of a human component here. They did the right thing. They reestablished trust. They are telling us, we learned from our mistakes so that you can as well. In the scope of monitoring systems, trust is the ultimate currency because a monitoring system is literally a measurement system for the health of other systems. If you cannot trust your measurement system, what is the point of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you usually only get one go with that as well. If you burn that trust, it&amp;rsquo;s gonna be very, very hard to build up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is something that touches me very personal because I used to work on a solution that was exquisitely powerful, but therefore also very complicated and complex. And the moment you have automation, someone somewhere sometimes is going to be broken by it. And reestablishing that trust was never easy and sometimes impossible depending on the scale of failure that you&amp;rsquo;re well-intended means of automatically monitoring something I should have brought to the customer. Something that we seldom say as an industry, when we try to sell a product to somebody else, is that everything has a cost. If you want to take away complexity from you to roll out very simple systems and set up that thing, reports stuff over there, and you want it to automatically, there&amp;rsquo;s a higher risk that the automation will cause an issue. Of course, that in many cases is a justified risk. You can roll out the monitoring gradually and the easier it is to roll out a monitoring system at scale, the more you reach the holy grail of monitoring, that is the network effect. The moment that you can start observing how issues in systems propagate, correlate, or are not correlated there is something very important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s talk a bit more about the characteristics of a good observability stack. We&amp;rsquo;ve already mentioned a few we&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned that, it should be independent as much as possible from the systems that they&amp;rsquo;re trying to monitor. We&amp;rsquo;ve also said that maybe we should also take into account the human side of things rather than just the technological. Maybe you should tailor the complexity of your observability stack to the size and experience and structure of your teams. What are some other things that you both could name in your ideal observability stack?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that I really like to highlight here is the ease of use or the economics of the system that you are using. I used to do a analogy to how EpiPens work for people with allergies. If you&amp;rsquo;re eating a peanut and you&amp;rsquo;re allergic to peanuts, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to have to assemble the cure for that, right. Or something that alleviates or takes you out of immediate danger. You need it to be simple, just as take it out, push it in your leg, and it&amp;rsquo;s done. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to think about it. The same goes for monitoring or observability systems as well I would say. If you have to, when you&amp;rsquo;re awakened by a notification in the middle of the night, and maybe you&amp;rsquo;re even hung over or worse, and you are supposed to fix something that is critical, and you have to start thinking about what to do, then your observability system has in my eyes, at least failed you, you need to be able to get a notification that says this is wrong, here&amp;rsquo;s the data that proves that, click here to get a closer look and just be presented with all the information you need to be able to make a decent decision on how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing recently on that note that I&amp;rsquo;ve come across is how potentially easy it is for a new Blake me to set up a whole observability stack or at least monitoring, but he could definitely expand upon it is EBPF, because we&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about distribution of systems and also of observability related services, but there&amp;rsquo;s also a trend of going lower and lower level, right? And EBPF monitoring is monitoring at the kernel level, recently with some people from the k6 team, Artem Charlie, Kevin, Danielle, Lopez, shout out to those guys. We did this hackathon project actually for EBPF monitoring. And the whole reason that I got into it was because the promise was you install this binary, you drop it into your cluster on your local machine. And then it just kind of exposes magically all of these things that I normally would have had to set up like node exporters for, you know, it was we&amp;rsquo;re living in a golden age of monitoring and observability I think. The things that are possible, like I can&amp;rsquo;t even keep up anymore, be talking about ergonomics. I mean, what is more ergonomic than not having to do much of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are talking about the day one, the fact that it is so easy to set up apart from monitoring system is exactly what you need to be able to monitor at scale. It removes the thought. EBPF is a fantastic technology. We are fundamentally given a virtual machine to run inside the kernel to execute logic, that allows us to do in a centralized place. Things that in the past were almost impossible. For example, the first thing I ever did with a team of vinyl in Stanhope with EBPF was actually to detect how a process that, that was impossible in user land. But with EBPF, it was actually pretty simple. We literally spent more time making sure that the techniques would work across all the operating systems that we need to support and to figure out how to find out that. EBPF the, I see two big potentials for that, for things that are not possible already today with sufficient tips. The first one is to give us a distributed tracing tool that largely independent from their own time. Now there are technology limitations there. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to find out how to trace context. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that someone somewhere out there is figuring it out as we speak, probably, that we reduce to some extent the toil that is necessary to support the federal fire hose of new technologies, libraries, and stuff like that is put in production every day. But the second one that excites me even more because the shoot the tracing is largely already possible is actually to have cheap enough in terms of overhead and consistent enough across run times production profiling. People look at distributed tracing as a way of figuring out what is slow. And it works remarkably well as long as the bottleneck is in between processes, the moment you want to drill down, why this requests into the insight, this process was taking too long. You see what you&amp;rsquo;re tracing is not so suited anymore. You end up looking at the leaf instead of the forest, because there is so many more requests going on through the system, that unless you have a lot of spans that are very, very detailed and fundamentally to trace threat level profiling, you are not going to which costs a huge amount of overhead. You are not going to have the information needed to find out, okay, good stock in the Dow library again. However, the moment that you have things, basically you have to find out where the CPU, memory or location, memory usage and wait time hotspots are in your application. You actually have the first places to work at to improve the overall system. It&amp;rsquo;s not gonna tell you why that request was going badly, but the moment you saw the hotspot, you are virtually guaranteed that many requests are going to get better. And then you can measure them again in terms of input output, observability tracing. Now people out there are going to say, Michele, what the hell are we talking about? Today we have a lot of amazing technologies to the production profile and they are true because for example, they are right because for example, if you look at the Java virtual machine with, for example, the Java flight recorder, you have excellent facilities with super low overhead to figure out what is your Java or cuddling or cradle program doing true. But they&amp;rsquo;re very specific to the particular run time and to a particular programming language. And when you start comparing what wait time, for example, looks like in Golang as respected over to machine with code routines, instead of, I dunno, loom threads, project loom, and all the rest of the stuff, you end up actually having telemetry that seems to say the same things, but in reality has a different semantic. And that is a challenge in our systems that have more and more grown polyglot. When we had the, our happy little monolith fault, it was one language. Now this year the systems are implementation of many different languages that behaves differently, and yet they are operated in some cases by roughly the same people, for example, necessarily teams, right? Having fluency in terms of performance across several languages is a significant challenge. Now, if we actually get through EBPF production profiling, for example, the folks behind parka and also the folks we have big pixie, there&amp;rsquo;s an amazing job there. If we manage to have something that will give us close enough, precise enough production, profiling information across whatever we may wanna throw into a container that is going to be a generational change in terms of making complex systems run better at scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s something that we&amp;rsquo;re interested in at k6 as well. I mean, I&amp;rsquo;m a performance Sesser so the first thing I think of as the network side of it, there are a lot of network metrics that could be gathered at that level. And the reality now is that without EBPF, you&amp;rsquo;re in this position where each new service has needs some other exporter that you need to install. And like there&amp;rsquo;s so many plugins to plugins and many different combinations of things, when really they might all be using HTTP. Like, why don&amp;rsquo;t we have something that just detects, maybe not, it won&amp;rsquo;t be everything right. It&amp;rsquo;s never EBPF has never going to completely be able to, or, well, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t say never because you know, that could change very quickly, but I don&amp;rsquo;t see it as being the end all be all solution. But if it can provide some of the more common metrics, that&amp;rsquo;s already a step in the right direction. Talk about usability and ergonomics right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And also provide a safe assessable baseline across a lot of different technologies working together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeah. For sure. What other things do you think would you have in your ideal observability stack?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You asked me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either of you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go ahead Michele, I don&amp;rsquo;t have a lot of ideas on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, actually, if you go on the, okay, can I make us most shield for a link? If you go on google, WWW.ubuntu.com/whatisobservability/whatisobservability. There you see a kind of overview of the things that I find most meaningful, monitoring different types of systems. Second, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna give here that your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They can share my screen record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I assume you want this one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. So this page is fundamentally a work of love of Simme and I, about the way we see observe a PVT. And the diagram that you see on screen is a, of course, simplified and very generic can your manage me if I lie, but it is a thirst overview of the kind of telemetry that you use at different levels in your infrastructure in order to monitor things. This is important for filamentary two reasons. One, is to provide guidance for people that may be new to observability in terms of which things to focus first, when you look at the telemetry types that are used on the right hand side, you will see that metrics and logs are of course universal. That&amp;rsquo;s what we started with. They are very good. Every software that deserves to run somewhere is capable of emitting clogs. Most of them can emit metrics and more and more, thanks to primitives that is really proud. There are the metrics sometimes serious thing to the forefront of enterprise systems. It didn&amp;rsquo;t used to be that. Then you start seeing that profiling gets, for example, the moment you move above the virtualization hardware, and you start talking about processes and applications, profiling them makes perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry Michele for cutting you off. But I think you might need to need to explain the icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is correct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s really. We don&amp;rsquo;t have that context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, they don&amp;rsquo;t explain themselves. Maybe then you use amino the icons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the chart that you see on the left hand side is metrics, mentors, time series fundamental. That&amp;rsquo;s what we use to monitor things. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot. Then the table with the reds and greens and yellows followed by text that locks, the old, that bar chart is actually supposed to be flamed charts and that&amp;rsquo;s profiling showing hotspots. The strange thing with all those horizontal bars that is distributed tracing, that is the best way I can come up with to visualize spans. Spans is the basic data structure in distributed tracing. It describes an action taken by system to process a request. For example, you would have a span for the receiver of an HTTP request. The span is opened is created when your HTTP server is receiving the request, it&amp;rsquo;s going to be closed, but it simply is doing amazing things to get to the image in a screen&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of this you&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen in your browser, was what I was about to say, like something similar when you browse on webpage, you&amp;rsquo;d get this span alike view of how the different correlate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s similar, but there is a key difference. One of the key concepts of distributed tracing as coming from dapper, which is fundamentally the progenitor of all modern distributed systems is the parent-child relation between spans, which is the closest you can get to cow&amp;rsquo;s reality. We are, for example, when your application is receiving an HTTP request and is issuing your query to Mongo to retrieve some data, you will have a parent&amp;rsquo;s span for the receiver of the HP request. And the child&amp;rsquo;s span that says, I spoke to Mongo, took me this longer. And this query, I got so many data back that is the parent-child relation. And it fundamentally, you would not have spoken to Mongo if not for the incoming request. Now things get Merck here when we talk about a synchronous messaging, because the beauty and simplicity of the trees of spans that you have in synchronous systems, kind of get lost with a messaging the moment that you have batch consumers. You&amp;rsquo;ll have many requests that result in a whole bunch of messaging being queued up in your messaging queue. And one application consuming messages originated in different traces all at once, fundamentally creating a merge, but I digress. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. So we were talking about&amp;hellip; I just get so excited about this future tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, it&amp;rsquo;s great. I know that you said that you have a hard stop and I&amp;rsquo;d like to get you off a little bit early for your meeting Michele, but why don&amp;rsquo;t you talk about what Canonical has to do with observability at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, can I call does a lot of things, including a very beloved operating system together with an amazing community of volunteers, Ubuntu, we are responsible for a huge amount of software. We have offerings for Kubernetes, for OpenStack, for SAF, for a lot of systems that people use to run their applications and data centers. And it is the mission of Simme and I to make sure that those systems come with excellent monitoring capabilities, that you can monitor them with open source software, whether or not you want to use the monitoring system that Canonical provides you. At the end of the day, what we&amp;rsquo;re doing is in variable source fashion. We want to make sure that all the appliances that you can get from Canonical, the SAF, the OpenStack, the Kubernetes is, there are the cube flows and all the machine learning. They are, you can monitor them with best-in-class open source monitoring tools like videos, like getting logs out of SIS log, the security traces with open telemetry, where it makes sense. And that is the part of the work of Simme and I, that is about stepping up the game in terms of making software provided by Canonical observable in a way that you can use, for example, with your existing monitoring system, we really believe every single word we say, when we say the metric, once France, it&amp;rsquo;s all about having radio systems be monitored together. Now, if you do not happen to have a radio monitoring system, wherever monitoring the rest, we can give you one, but if you have a monitoring system and you&amp;rsquo;re comfortable with it, you by all rights should be able to monitor whatever piece of software you get from Canonical with it. And this is what to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s awesome. I wish we had more time to talk about this, but maybe we can have you both in some future episode, I feel like there&amp;rsquo;s so many things that I wanted to dig deeper into, but thank you both for coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am so happy. Simme I&amp;rsquo;m so happy to have you back on again. I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed doing these with you, so it&amp;rsquo;s a little bit weird that you&amp;rsquo;re now on as a guest, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy that you&amp;rsquo;re also bringing things that you&amp;rsquo;ve learned at Canonical back to us. And Michele welcome. I&amp;rsquo;d love to have you&amp;ndash;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back again for sure with or without Simme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anytime. But Simme is finer yeah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All right. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure. Sure. Thank you everybody for watching and I guess we&amp;rsquo;ll see you next week. Bye everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bye, have a wonderful day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>How to Use Executors in k6: Adapting Load Test Workload Models to Production</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220118-how-to-use-executors-in-k6-adapting-load-test-workload-models-to-production/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 22:45:52 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220118-how-to-use-executors-in-k6-adapting-load-test-workload-models-to-production/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Executors in k6 are like traffic cops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They define the shape and volume of traffic that your k6 load testing script follows during test execution. Executors can also drastically affect your results if you don&amp;rsquo;t get them right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are all the executor options in k6 and when you should use each one:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;k6-executors&#34;&gt;k6 executors&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;shared-iterations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Fix the number of total iterations for the entire test. Use when you want to create precisely X rows of test data during a prep run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;per-vu-iterations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Fix the number of iterations each virtual user (VU) does. Use when you want each VU to use exactly X rows of test data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;constant-vus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Fix the number of VUs and duration, but allow the number of iterations to vary. Use for straightforward tests or shakeout tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ramping-vus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Set stages, each with a number of VUs and a duration, and let the number of iterations vary. Use for easiest comparison with other load testing tools and for custom load profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;constant-arrival-rate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Fix the number of requests per second (rps) and duration, and allow the number of VUs and iterations to vary. Use when you have a simple load profile with a request throughput requirement (rps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ramping-arrival rate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;constant-arrival-rate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, but with stages. For each stage, fix the number of rps and duration. Use for spike tests, multiphase load profiles with distinct requirements, and Game Day simulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;externally-controlled&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Fix max VUs and time, and allow everything else to be changed at runtime. Use for disaster recovery, breakpoint, or stress tests where you want ultimate flexibility in adapting your test to real-time results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;still-unsure&#34;&gt;Still unsure?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ramping-vus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s probably what you&amp;rsquo;re used to from other tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ready to move up? Use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ramping-arrival-rate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Rps is a better (but still not perfect) measure of throughput for comparison than just the number of VUs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-in-doubt-look-at-production&#34;&gt;When in doubt, look at production.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making sure your test looks and acts like real traffic yields the best results!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more details, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/scenarios/#executors&#34;&gt;the k6 documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Testing tool cheat sheet for load testers who don&#39;t just care about numbers</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220117-testing-tool-cheat-sheet-for-load-testers-who-dont-just-care-about-numbers/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 16:30:07 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20220117-testing-tool-cheat-sheet-for-load-testers-who-dont-just-care-about-numbers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not enough to decide &lt;em&gt;how much&lt;/em&gt; load you want to generate. You also have to know &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;rsquo;re generating it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your approach affects what part of your application is tested, the results returned, and the budget you&amp;rsquo;ll need to run your test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are three main categories of load testing tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;protocol-based-load-testing-tools&#34;&gt;Protocol-based load testing tools:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tools simulate the underlying messages sent back and forth between an application and a client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose a protocol-based tool if&lt;/em&gt;: you want to generate massive load, you want to load test before components are integrated, you want to test APIs, or you are budget-conscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best in class tools&lt;/em&gt;: Gatling, JMeter, k6, Locust, Neoload&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;browser-based-load-testing-tools&#34;&gt;Browser-based load testing tools:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tools automate real user interactions with an interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose a browser-based tool if:&lt;/em&gt; you want to measure end-to-end performance, you want to reuse your browser automation scripts, you want front-end performance metrics, or you have a higher budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best in class tools:&lt;/em&gt; Cypress, Flood Element, k6, Playwright, Puppeteer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hybrid-load-testing-tools&#34;&gt;Hybrid load testing tools:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach is a mixture of the previous two. You can do this in a few ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a protocol tool to generate the majority of the load, and a browser tool for a handful of virtual users &lt;em&gt;(best functionality, highest effort/cost)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a browser-based tool for all load &lt;em&gt;(expensive, simplest)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a tool that can do both &lt;em&gt;(ideal solution, few options)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whatever-you-choose-compare-like-with-like&#34;&gt;Whatever you choose, compare like with like.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy testing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this k6 Office Hours, k6 CEO Robin Gustafsson joined me to talk to Daniel Knittl-Frank, a software engineer at Eurofunk, about how k6 is used in the emergency services industry. Daniel has an interesting use case for k6: he uses it to load test calls in Austria received from the 112 emergency services hotline!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spoke at the Performance Objective meetup to talk about how to use k6 and Grafana for beginners. I always enjoy talking to like-minded engineers, and I think sharing ideas in a meetup context is probably the best way to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was really excited to have Hans Knecht on this week&amp;rsquo;s Office Hours. Hans works at Mission Lane, and is one of the biggest contributors to a k6 extension called k6 operator. k6 Operator lets you create a k6 custom resource object in Kubernetes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this week&amp;rsquo;s k6 Office Hours, we attempted to steer into Halloween by talking about some of the most common performance testing issues we&amp;rsquo;ve faced in our careers as performance testing consultants. For this one, I had Tom Miseur join me to commiserate and swap stories.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s Office Hours, I wanted to talk about the intersection of Site Reliability Engineering and performance testing, so I decided to invite two people with different backgrounds from me to discuss it. Stephen Townshend is a performance engineer who recently changed jobs to become an SRE, and Daniel González Lopes is an SRE who had not had experience in performance testing before he joined k6. It turned out to be a great talk!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did you know that every new person to k6 does a Week of Testing? It&amp;rsquo;s a k6 tradition for new hires to spend their first week seeing firsthand what the experience of a new user of k6 is like. How quickly do they find the documentation? What issues do they get stuck on? Then, at the end of the week, the new employees do a presentation for the rest of the team to show their first impressions and findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s Office Hours, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/inancgumus&#34;&gt;İnanç Gümüş&lt;/a&gt;, one of the newest k6 team members, shares his presentation and his experience as a k6 beginner. Another colleague, Viktor Mihajlović, a Technical Customer Success Engineer, also shares some of the most commonly asked questions he&amp;rsquo;s heard on the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why I love to learn human languages, and what Esperanto sounds like&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the Grafana acquisition of k6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what performance testing is, anyway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;whether everyone needs to do performance testing, and my personal setup for this blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chaos engineering and Schrödinger&amp;rsquo;s Pokémon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;an overview of the Grafana Labs projects landscape&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what k6 is, and how we would get started for free (k6 OSS)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was a video I pre-recorded in preparation for &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20211005-testing-with-k6-and-grafana-better-together/&#34;&gt;the first Grafana EMEA virtual meetup&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gvounvDSDGg&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In mid-June (just three months ago), k6 joined the Grafana Labs family. Many people didn&amp;rsquo;t quite understand what the connection was between k6 and Grafana, but I thought it made a lot of sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&amp;rsquo;s Site Reliability Engineering book talks about 4 golden signals that we should measure in a system: latency, traffic, errors, and saturation. Load testing provides 3 of those (latency, traffic, and errors), but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t show saturation, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t give us visibility into the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grafana brings observability. k6 brings data. They work really well together, which is why we&amp;rsquo;ve been using each other&amp;rsquo;s products for a few years now, before there was ever any talk of an acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this video, I talk about why k6 and Grafana are better together and also demonstrate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to run a simple script in k6 OSS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;how to make sense of the results of a load test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;test execution options: running locally, sending results to k6 Cloud, and running a test from k6 Cloud&amp;ndash; all triggered using the CLI&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;two different integration options to bring k6 and Grafana together: the k6 Cloud Grafana data source plugin and Prometheus Remote Write&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this Office Hours, I invited my colleague Tom Miseur and friend Leandro Melendez, aka Señor Performo, to talk all about different criteria in performance testing, including non-functional requirements, SLAs, SLOs, SLIs, thresholds, and checks. Criteria at different levels is how we determine whether testing, including performance testing, has been successful, so it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand what they are and incorporate them into testing scripts and processes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this first EMEA session of the Grafana Labs virtual meetups, I talked about how to use k6 and Grafana together to get the full performance picture for a software application. Observability, using tools like Prometheus and Grafana, lets us see what&amp;rsquo;s going on inside the application, and load testing, using k6, helps us get those insights earlier on in software cycles, such as during pre-production.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bill Rainaud is an inside account executive at k6, which means he talks to users and potential users of k6 every day. In this Office Hours, he explains how to get started with load testing using k6 Cloud, which is a SaaS platform for running and scaling up load tests on the cloud. We also answered a few frequently asked questions about k6&amp;rsquo;s capabilities and how to do correlation in k6.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My co-host &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I had invited Adron Hall from &lt;a href=&#34;https://hasura.io&#34;&gt;Hasura&lt;/a&gt; to come talk to us about how to load test a GraphQL API, but he was unable to come due to unforeseen circumstances. Luckily, Tom Miseur, who is part of the Professional Services branch of k6, was able to step in on very little notice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom has done a load testing engagement using k6 that involved Hasura, so he was able to tell us what it is and how it can be tested with k6. It turned out really well, thankfully!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tonight I did a webinar with Grafana Labs&amp;ndash; the first k6-related webinar since the acquisition. I was more than a little nervous to give it, because I knew I was introducing k6 to a lot of new users, but also to Grafana for the first time. I think it went pretty well! I was still quite relieved when it was over, however. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the webinar, I talk about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why it&amp;rsquo;s still a good idea to do load testing in pre-production&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;what k6 is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;why k6 and Grafana together make sense&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and how to integrate k6 and Grafana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s quite a bit of demo in it, and I also had the k6 CEO, Robin Gustafsson, join me for Q&amp;amp;A as a nice treat.&lt;/p&gt;

You can also go through my slides &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WOA50nqIv1NoiHBxGIH_JM02rZqSjX81gHTlwPJ5i1U/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, if you&amp;rsquo;d like.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, I gave a presentation at New Relic&amp;rsquo;s FutureStack conference about &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210730-schrodingers-pokemon/&#34;&gt;chaos engineering with k6 and New Relic&lt;/a&gt;. A few months ago, k6 got acquired by &lt;a href=&#34;https://grafana.com&#34;&gt;Grafana Labs&lt;/a&gt;, and so I wanted to redo it, but with the Grafana stack this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the result, and I think I like this iteration even better:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I presented this talk at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSgH3I8_ldk&#34;&gt;TestCon Europe 2021&lt;/a&gt; today, although the audio sync issues were not great, so I recommend you watch the video above instead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/grantyoung86/&#34;&gt;Grant Young&lt;/a&gt;, Software Engineer in Test at GitLab, joined &lt;a href=&#34;https://grafana.com/k6&#34;&gt;k6 OSS&lt;/a&gt; maintainer &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MStoykov&#34;&gt;Mihail Stoykov&lt;/a&gt; and me to talk about how GitLab uses k6. Apparently, they began using k6 internally some time ago, and because they like to eat their own dogfood and use GitLab to test GitLab, they also incorporated k6 into GitLab so that their users could reap the benefits, too.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/USI_LeeBarnes&#34;&gt;Lee Barnes&lt;/a&gt; and I got connected because we are both speaking at &lt;a href=&#34;https://testcon.lt/&#34;&gt;TestCon Europe 2021&lt;/a&gt; this year, and I thought it would be nice to have a chat with him before the conference to get a sneak peek at what he&amp;rsquo;s presenting about: continuous performance testing. Lee is the CEO of &lt;a href=&#34;https://utopiasolutions.com/&#34;&gt;Utopia Solutions&lt;/a&gt;, and he&amp;rsquo;s been in the testing industry for decades, so I really appreciated his insights on where the industry is going.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to debug k6 load testing scripts with Tom Miseur (k6 Office Hours #25)</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210820-koh25-k6_load_testing_scripts/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 14:38:11 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210820-koh25-k6_load_testing_scripts/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/tommiseur/&#34;&gt;Tom Miseur&lt;/a&gt; joined k6 at about the same time I did late last year, and we immediately hit it off because we both come from a performance testing consulting background AND we both had worked for different competing testing tool vendors before moving to k6. I was excited to have him on k6 Office Hours to talk about a topic we both had a lot to say about: how to debug load testing scripts, and specifically k6 scripts. We got a chance to do a bit of a show-and-tell of tools that we use that we use, and they are all independent of k6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://wireshark.org&#34;&gt;Wireshark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.charlesproxy.com&#34;&gt;Charles Proxy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mitmproxy.org&#34;&gt;mitmproxy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.telerik.com/fiddler&#34;&gt;Fiddler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://proxyman.io&#34;&gt;Proxyman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got to demo &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/benc-uk/k6-reporter&#34;&gt;a cool HTML reporting dashboard&lt;/a&gt; that Ben Coleman, a k6 user, created. While it&amp;rsquo;s not baked into the tool itself, it&amp;rsquo;s fairly straightforward to add it, requiring only two snippets of code that can be pasted onto any script.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Kubedim: Microservices testing using k6 for reliability, with Kelvin Zhang (k6 Office Hours #24)</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210813-kubedim-microservices-testing/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210813-kubedim-microservices-testing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, my colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gonzalezlopes.com/&#34;&gt;Daniel González Lopes&lt;/a&gt; joined me as a co-host on k6 Office Hours, and we interviewed &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kelvzhan&#34;&gt;Kelvin Zhang&lt;/a&gt; about his thesis at Imperial College London, using k6 to test microservices-based architectures. He created something called Kubedim, an application that intelligently applies non-uniform brownout theory to intentionally dim application requests for the purpose of improving overall availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a dense Office Hours to digest, but Kelvin really impressed us with his experiments and findings! It&amp;rsquo;s definitely an awesome use case for k6 and just a great one to watch for any site reliability engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

As Grafana Labs continues to grow, we’d like you to get to know the team members who are working on the cool stuff you’re using. Check out the latest of our Friday team profiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;meet-nicole&#34;&gt;Meet Nicole!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name: Nicole van der Hoeven&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/profilepic-1MB.png&#34; alt=&#34;photo of Nicole&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;current-locationtime-zone&#34;&gt;Current location/time zone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I currently live in Maastricht, in the Netherlands. I moved here with my husband four years ago from Melbourne, Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-do-you-do-at-grafana-labs&#34;&gt;What do you do at Grafana Labs?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a Developer Advocate at &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io&#34;&gt;k6&lt;/a&gt;, but I’m not actually a developer — I’m a performance tester! I guess there’s no such thing as a Performance Tester Advocate? My job is part engineering, part content creation: I write load testing scripts and code, but I also write blog posts, produce videos, and give presentations. I found out I was joining Grafana Labs a few months ago &lt;a href=&#34;https://grafana.com/about/press/2021-06-17-grafana-labs-brings-modern-open-source-load-testing-to-observability-with-acquisition-of-k6/&#34;&gt;when k6 was acquired&lt;/a&gt;, but I was happy to join the team! I’ve met some fun and motivated people at Grafana Labs that I’m eager to collaborate with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-open-source-projects-do-you-contribute-to&#34;&gt;What open source projects do you contribute to?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a budding developer and still learning the ins and outs of social coding, but some things I’ve contributed to recently are &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/xk6-chaos&#34;&gt;a chaos engineering extension for k6&lt;/a&gt; (created by my colleague, the talented &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simon Aronsson&lt;/a&gt;), an application called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/pokeapi&#34;&gt;Poké API&lt;/a&gt; that I’ve added chaos experiments to, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/readwise2directory&#34;&gt;a Python script&lt;/a&gt; for pushing my Kindle highlights to my note-taking app of choice, &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-are-your-github-and-twitter-handles&#34;&gt;What are your GitHub and Twitter handles?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nicolevanderhoeven&#34;&gt;nicolevanderhoeven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter: &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/n_vanderhoeven&#34;&gt;n_vanderhoeven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-do-you-like-to-do-in-your-free-time&#34;&gt;What do you like to do in your free time?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons eight hours a week, &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Fork+My+Brain&#34;&gt;take a ridiculous amount of notes on everything&lt;/a&gt;, and vlog about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/c/luckydippers&#34;&gt;my (pre-COVID) travels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/battlemap.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Battle map on a TV lying on a table, from a Dungeons &amp; Dragons game&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A battle map in one of my Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons games.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-your-favorite-new-gadget-or-tech-toy&#34;&gt;What’s your favorite new gadget or tech toy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My new Rødecaster Pro, an audio mixer that has quickly become an essential part of my audio and video production process. It takes up a huge amount of precious real estate on my desk, but it is absolutely worth it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/desksetup.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Bird&amp;rsquo;s eye view of Nicole&amp;rsquo;s current desk&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My current desk setup, including the Rødecaster Pro peeking out from underneath the laptop in the upper right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-the-best-part-of-your-job&#34;&gt;What’s the best part of your job?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got into Developer Relations and advocacy in general because I realized that, as a performance testing consultant, I was being asked the same questions and solving the same problems. So I started to share my experience online, and I’ve found that significantly more efficient. Why explain something repeatedly to one person at a time, on the spot, when you could post a more considered explanation online and potentially help an unlimited amount of people? A large part of my job is simplifying technical concepts and making it accessible to beginners, and I love being able to help others by creating the content I looked for when I was a beginner, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s one of my YouTube videos:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/_DB-lNZW7LQ&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-the-last-thing-you-binge-watched&#34;&gt;What’s the last thing you binge-watched?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have binge-watched the entire two campaigns of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/c/criticalrole&#34;&gt;Critical Role&lt;/a&gt;, a livestream of a Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons game with a bunch of voice actors, which is over 1000 hours of watch time. Totally worth it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-superpowers-do-you-have&#34;&gt;What superpowers do you have?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I speak several languages: Tagalog (my native language), English, Dutch, Spanish, Esperanto, German, and French — in that order and to varying degrees. I am learning and have learned more, but don’t yet feel confident enough to claim to “speak” them! I choose travel destinations based on how interested I am in learning the local language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/esperanto-superpower.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Nicole wearing a shirt that says &amp;ldquo;I speak Esperanto. What&amp;rsquo;s your superpower?&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-your-zoom-virtual-background-and-why&#34;&gt;What’s your Zoom virtual background and why?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t use virtual backgrounds. The thing I like most about video is that it’s the most honest form of expression: writing, podcasting, and photography can all be edited far more easily. I like that my home office gives clues about who I am and what I like, and I would never want to hide that — mess and all!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Running a load test is half of the equation, and not having the right observability tools to see how your application responds to the load can sometimes flat-out invalidate a test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s how to install open-source tools Grafana and Prometheus on a Kubernetes cluster in DigitalOcean and how a performance user could use them for increased visibility during a load test.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this episode of k6 Office Hours, I got the k6 Chief Technical Officer, Pawel Suwala, to give a bit of a behind-the-scenes of how we work at k6 and what we&amp;rsquo;re working on next. We talked about the methodology we use for building k6, the different teams we have, and exciting new features that are coming soon!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A tester&#39;s overview of Grafana Labs open-source projects</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since the acquisition of k6 by Grafana Labs, the entire k6 team has been absorbed into the new, larger team that we&amp;rsquo;re suddenly a part of. Grafana Labs maintains a lot of projects, so I was very quickly overwhelmed with things to learn about all of them. Here&amp;rsquo;s my attempt to make sense of the Grafana Labs landscape, and perhaps it can help some of you as well:&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to run distributed load tests with k6 Operator (k6 Office Hours #21)</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210716-koh-k6-operator/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 18:17:13 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210716-koh-k6-operator/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this week&amp;rsquo;s Office Hours, &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I talked about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/grafana/k6-operator&#34;&gt;k6 Operator&lt;/a&gt;, which is a open-source project that Simme created for distributed load testing with k6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 Cloud already offers a no-hassle distributed load testing experience, but for those who prefer to use their own infrastructure, k6 Operator allows the setup of a k6 test as a custom resource object that can be deployed along with a Kubernetes cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Continuous testing means verifying and improving software quality at all stages, including development. It can sound like something only large companies do, but it&amp;rsquo;s an approach I use even for this personal blog that you&amp;rsquo;re reading this on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every new blog post or change I make to this site automatically triggers the execution of a small test. This test, when run over time, lets me see whether changes I&amp;rsquo;ve made have been detrimental to site performance. Here&amp;rsquo;s a video on my setup:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;José Luis Latorre Millas, Developer Community Lead and Software Architect at Swiss Life AG, joined &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and me on k6 Office Hours to talk about how he personally uses k6 with Azure DevOps to add load testing to his team&amp;rsquo;s CI/CD pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to know José from the k6 Community Slack workspace when he mentioned that he would be presenting on k6 in a few meetups. I went to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HITJg03AQFo&amp;amp;t=112s&#34;&gt;his livestream with CrossDvlUp&lt;/a&gt; (Spanish) and enjoyed his approach, so I knew I wanted to have him on. It&amp;rsquo;s always great to have real users of k6 (both of the OSS and the commercial Cloud option) talk about how they personally use k6 and even what they found lacking in the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week on k6 Office Hours, &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I were joined by two CEOs: k6 CEO &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinegustafsson/&#34;&gt;Robin Gustafsson&lt;/a&gt; and Grafana Labs CEO &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/nopzor&#34;&gt;Raj Dutt&lt;/a&gt;. It was a little nerve-wracking to have two CEOs on the stream, but it did give us the opportunity to ask both of them pointed questions on Grafana Labs&amp;rsquo;s acquisition of k6, including any plans they have for how both companies could integrate better in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, during Grafanaconline 2021, &lt;a href=&#34;https://grafana.com/about/press/2021-06-17-grafana-labs-brings-modern-open-source-load-testing-to-observability-with-acquisition-of-k6/&#34;&gt;Grafana Labs CEO Raj Dutt announced&lt;/a&gt; the acquisition of k6&amp;ndash; the company I work for. What does this mean? Here&amp;rsquo;s a video I made to explain it all:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/t1agJsLwrGE&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I have also discussed the acquisition twice on k6 Office Hours:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrDo2wMeV80&#34;&gt;once with our CEO, Robin Gustafsson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;and another time with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfWIB-myito&#34;&gt;both Robin and Raj, Grafana Labs CEO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TL;DW: We unanimously agree it&amp;rsquo;s a positive thing. I myself am cautiously optimistic about the future of both k6 and Grafana Labs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to use k6 to benchmark hosting providers with Kevin Ohashi (k6 Office Hours #18)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kevinohashi&#34;&gt;Kevin Ohashi&lt;/a&gt; joined me and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/FloorDrees/&#34;&gt;Floor Drees&lt;/a&gt; on k6 Office Hours to talk about how he used k6 to &lt;a href=&#34;https://wphostingbenchmarks.com/&#34;&gt;benchmark the performance of WordPress hosting providers&lt;/a&gt;. He talks about the difficulties he ran into while trying to keep tests repeatable and consistent, and I also make some suggestions for how he could improve his load testing script for future comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of particular note for me in his results was how clearly the performance of the hosting providers varied depending on the location Kevin had selected for his load generators. One in particular showed a significant delay when a site was fetched from Sydney, indicating the possibility of a lack of a CDN server in that region. It made a great argument for load testing in the cloud, from different geographical regions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On this week&amp;rsquo;s Office Hours, &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I were joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinegustafsson/&#34;&gt;Robin Gustafsson&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of k6, to make a big announcement: k6 has been acquired by Grafana Labs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The folks at Grafana Labs have been fans of k6 for a while, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been fans (and users) of their work since almost the beginning of k6. While a surprise to many, Grafana and k6 together is a combination that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;

Every new person at k6 goes through a week of testing, and Floor decided to spend her week of testing doing an accessibility review on the k6 Cloud web app and documentation. We talk about how accessibiltiy is an often-overlooked form of operational testing, and Floor shares specific tools that testers can use to make applications more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also discuss the k6 open source support program, which makes k6 free for open-source maintainers and regular contributors.&lt;/p&gt;

Iván, who is a System Architect at NNG LLC, is the most active k6 extension creator outside of the k6 team. Mihail is a software engineer at k6, and one third of the k6 OSS team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked about the many extensions Iván has created for k6 so that he can incorporate k6 into his team&amp;rsquo;s daily testing activities, his considerations for creating extensions, and how he got started. Mihail also shares some inside information on why certain decisions were made about the way k6 is structured, and common mistakes he sees people make in their custom extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, we had &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/odysseas_lam&#34;&gt;Odysseas Lamtzidis&lt;/a&gt; on the show to talk about &lt;a href=&#34;https://netdata.cloud&#34;&gt;Netdata&lt;/a&gt;, which is an application performance monitoring tool that prides itself on having the easiest setup ever. Odysseas admitted that it might not have all the bells and whistles of other monitoring platforms, it Just Works. I see this as being very interesting especially for testers like me, who just want to have something set up but might not want to be bothered by the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>End-to-End Guide for Load Testing</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210524-end-to-end-guide-for-load-testing/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2021 10:48:55 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210524-end-to-end-guide-for-load-testing/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Originally published on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://abstracta.us/blog/performance-testing/load-testing-guide/&#34;&gt;Abstracta blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;link rel=&#34;canonical&#34; href=&#34;https://abstracta.us/blog/performance-testing/load-testing-guide/&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have a public-facing web application, the odds are you should probably be thinking about load testing.  Any tester can (and should) add load testing to their repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional tests are often carried out with a single user&amp;rsquo;s experience of your application in mind, but what happens when hundreds or thousands of users are on your site at the same time? Load testing helps prepare an application for this eventuality by simulating that situation before the application goes live. That way, you have time to fix any issues you find, and there are no nasty surprises in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this guide, I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk you through the basics of the load testing process, which fits in closely with traditional functional testing phases as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planning: &lt;em&gt;Why are we testing? What are we testing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing test scripts: &lt;em&gt;How are we testing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Execution: &lt;em&gt;Running test scripts against the application.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analysis and reporting: &lt;em&gt;What happened, and what do we need to fix?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;planning-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;Planning for load testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the planning phase, the team gets together and determines what load testing will involve, including the objectives, scope, resources needed, and test scenarios. The deliverable for this phase is a test plan, but that can be as formal or informal as the team requires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning for any testing is a team activity, and you&amp;rsquo;ll want to get input from all the stakeholders &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s anyone who is involved in or might be affected by the testing. The first thing you need to clarify is the reason for load testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;requirements&#34;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why are we doing load testing?&lt;/em&gt; seems like a very simple question, but you may be surprised by the varying answers from your stakeholders. Their reasons may require different test scenarios, so it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to agree on the collective objectives of this load testing cycle so that expectations are set accordingly. A requirement is a concise statement of how an application should behave in a given situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phrasing objectives as nonfunctional requirements (NFRs) is a good way to formalize them. An NFR defines the desired state of the application and can includes performance thresholds that the team decides on. For example: &lt;em&gt;Logging in as a registered user must take no more than 3 seconds (90th percentile response time)&lt;/em&gt; is a requirement based on response time. Good requirements are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Agreed Upon, Realistic, and Timely).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some other things that should be decided on during this phase:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scope&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;What are we testing?&lt;/em&gt; Deciding on a shared objective for load testing lets you narrow down what areas of the application need to be targeted. Make sure everyone is clear on what &lt;em&gt;won&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; be tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/daria-nepriakhina-zoCDWPuiRuA-unsplash.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Post-its on a board for planning&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo by &lt;a href=&#34;https://unsplash.com/@epicantus?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&#34;&gt;Daria Nepriakhina&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;https://unsplash.com/s/photos/post-it?utm_source=unsplash&amp;amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_content=creditCopyText&#34;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entry Criteria&lt;/strong&gt;. What do you need to begin? This is the time to start thinking about resources that are required for testing, including the number of people who need to be involved, the time it takes to carry out the testing, and environment requirements (including test data). You don&amp;rsquo;t always need a separate testing environment to do load testing, but if you do, that should be discussed up front so that the DevOps team knows you can&amp;rsquo;t begin without an environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workload Modeling&lt;/strong&gt;. A workload model is a set of characteristics that describe the load you&amp;rsquo;re attempting to simulate. If you want your load testing to simulate registered users accessing your site, what does that entail? This might require you to look through your site analytics to determine which pages are visited most often and which application features are most commonly used, or arrive at an estimate if analytics are not available. Are most users visiting from their laptops at lunch on work days, or do they use your site from mobile devices after work? Are most of them located in the US or in Europe? You&amp;rsquo;ll want your scripts to match real load as much as possible, so take note of key characteristics that might have an effect on the traffic your application experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Server monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;. Which application components will be involved? You want to have a plan in place to have monitoring, alerts, and logs set up on every server that will be tested by your scripts. If your load testing tool shows performance degradation, you want to be able to have information to look through on the relevant servers to troubleshoot that issue. Keep in mind that any sort of monitoring adds some resource overhead, so decide as a team what information you absolutely need to track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test Scenarios&lt;/strong&gt;. Which situations do you want to recreate? A test scenario objectively describes the situation to be simulated. Do you want to recreate the load profile of a typical day, or one from a very high-traffic period, such as during a sale? Do you want to recreate a production outage? You can use analytics data to come up with parameters for your each test scenario such as duration, number of concurrent users or requests, ramp up period (how quickly the application went from 0 users to your highest number of users), or how &amp;ldquo;spiky&amp;rdquo; the load needs to be (how the number of requests per second fluctuates throughout the test).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything discussed in this phase should be written in some sort of a load testing plan, which could be a formal, multi-page document, an epic with many user stories, or a bunch of Trello cards. Use the tools your team already uses. The format isn&amp;rsquo;t important; formalizing the outcome of the discussions is what counts. The test plan makes sure everyone has the same intent with regard to the testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing-load-testing-scripts&#34;&gt;Writing load testing scripts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to start writing scripts! You&amp;rsquo;ve already front-loaded a lot of the important decisions to the planning phase, so all that&amp;rsquo;s left to do in this step is to implement the plan in the form of load testing scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;tool-selection&#34;&gt;Tool selection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/tools_on_market.png&#34; alt=&#34;Different load testing tools on the market&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many load testing tools available on the market, and the reality is that you don&amp;rsquo;t always get to be the one to choose what you use. Often, companies have already made agreements with tool vendors for licenses before you begin your load testing, and it would be financially infeasible to switch to another tool. However, if you&amp;rsquo;re lucky enough that you can choose the load testing tool, here are a few considerations for assessing different tools:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;resources-and-costs&#34;&gt;Resources and costs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much does it cost? Does the pricing model allow for scaling usage up and down as necessary?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should you &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/what-to-consider-when-building-or-buying-a-load-testing-solution/&#34;&gt;build or buy&lt;/a&gt; an end-to-end load testing solution?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What technical skills or experience with tools does your team have? Who will be doing the testing?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;features&#34;&gt;Features&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the load testing tool support the protocols and technologies used by the application?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How easy would it be for the team to learn this tool and/or scripting language?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the tool make it easy for multiple people to collaborate on the same script?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does it integrate with other tools in the testing stack (for test management, test result analysis, server monitoring, team communication)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could you add this tool to your CI/CD pipeline?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the tool have an easy way of setting thresholds or SLOs for performance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are the test results displayed in usable reports, or does the tool integrate with existing data visualization tools you are using?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;support&#34;&gt;Support&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If something goes wrong, does customer support cost extra?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there ample documentation available online for getting started without help?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is there a community of users of the tool whose experiences you could learn from?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;scaling-up-load-testing&#34;&gt;Scaling up load testing&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many virtual users or requests per second can a single load generator simulate using the tool?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How many load generators would you need if you used this tool?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can the tool handle the amount of test data required by your tests?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you execute tests from different geographical locations, depending on your the location of your users?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the tool allow you to generate load from the cloud?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These questions are not exhaustive, but you can use them as a starting point for your comparisons of load testing tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this guide, I&amp;rsquo;m going to outline a basic script in &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io&#34;&gt;k6&lt;/a&gt; for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s open-source, so anyone reading this can download the tool and the script and try it out for themselves;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s written in JavaScript, which makes it easy to learn for front-end developers or testers who have used tools like Cypress, Puppeteer, or Playwright.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s capable of generating &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/testing-guides/running-large-tests/&#34;&gt;tens of thousands of users&lt;/a&gt; on a single machine, so it&amp;rsquo;s cost-effective even with load ramped up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the principles I discuss will be applicable to other tools. I highly recommend you conduct your own proof of concepts with several tools to come up with a tool that fits your particular situation, test scenarios, and company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;installation-and-setup&#34;&gt;Installation and setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re on a Mac, the easiest way to install k6 is to use Brew. Run &lt;code&gt;brew install k6&lt;/code&gt; from your terminal, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be ready to go in a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re on a different operating system, &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/&#34;&gt;check here for installation instructions&lt;/a&gt; that apply to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-basic-k6-test-script&#34;&gt;A basic k6 test script&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A barebones k6 test script looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;k6/http&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; () {
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;response&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;https://test.k6.io&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This script sends an HTTP GET request for the URL &lt;code&gt;https://test.k6.io&lt;/code&gt;, which is a simple test site. If you copy that code to your favorite text editor and save it as &lt;code&gt;test.js&lt;/code&gt;, you can then run it with the command &lt;code&gt;k6 run test.js&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll get something like this in response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/k6-supersimple-run.png&#34; alt=&#34;A sample run of a simple local test in k6&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A sample run of a simple local test in k6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The output above means that you&amp;rsquo;ve executed 1 iteration of your script with 1 virtual user from your local machine. The test run consisted of 1 HTTP request, which had a response time of 128.2 ms (&lt;code&gt;http_req_duration&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be tempting to start scaling up the test at this point, increasing the number of virtual users and the duration of the script. But there&amp;rsquo;s one problem with the script as it is: it&amp;rsquo;s not realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;making-a-test-script-realistic&#34;&gt;Making a test script realistic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of a load testing script is to simulate a real user who accesses your site. In most cases, that involves more than the simple GET request from the script above. Load testing scripts don&amp;rsquo;t have to mimic a real user &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt;, but they do have to be close enough so as to apply the same amount, shape, and distribution of the load on your application server. If your load testing scripts aren&amp;rsquo;t realistic enough, you may get false positives during testing and discover too late that there is a performance issue in an application component that your scripts didn&amp;rsquo;t test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways to make your scripts more realistic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;add-static-resources&#34;&gt;Add static resources&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a page has static resources like images and scripts that are retrieved by a browser automatically, make sure your script retrieves those too, as they will have an impact on the response times you get. Consider excluding static resources fetched from third-party providers unless you&amp;rsquo;ve gotten their permission to run a load test on their servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;set-cache-and-cookie-behavior&#34;&gt;Set cache and cookie behavior&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Review your load testing tool&amp;rsquo;s default cache and cookie management settings and change them, if necessary, to match the scenario you want to test. First-time visitors to a site won&amp;rsquo;t have resources cached locally, but repeat visitors may be retrieving resources from the cache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;add-think-time&#34;&gt;Add think time&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real users don&amp;rsquo;t usually fetch the same URL over and over again without stopping. They navigate to your site, then spend some time reading the contents of the homepage before they interact with the page again. Think time is the amount of time that a user spends “thinking”— that is, the delay between requests. Adding a think time that varies between 1 and 5 seconds, for example, prevents the application server from getting artificially bombarded by requests in a way that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t occur in production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;using-different-user-paths&#34;&gt;Using different user paths&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A user path is the flow of how a user interacts with the application. What pages do they visit? What information do they type in? So far, you&amp;rsquo;re only testing one request, but perhaps your users may be performing other actions. The workload model that you put together in the Planning phase will come into play here. Other actions like logging in or paying for items in a cart exercise different parts of an application than browsing does, so the load testing script should reflect the most common user flows through your system. In k6, this is done by adding scenarios, but other tools may call them thread groups or execution groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;adding-test-data&#34;&gt;Adding test data&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same way that users don&amp;rsquo;t (typically) search for the same keyword over and over again and don&amp;rsquo;t all log into the same test account, a script shouldn&amp;rsquo;t use the same data repeatedly. This behavior could cause responses to be cached, leading to misleadingly quick response times, or increased error rates, in the case of multiple virtual users attempting to log into the same account. To prevent that, modify your script to take data from a CSV file instead, letting you add some natural variation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;setting-test-parameters&#34;&gt;Setting test parameters&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test parameters are the main characteristics of the test and include the number of users, ramp up, duration, and ramp down. They control the shape of the user load, which you can see when you plot the number of virtual users over time during the test:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/k6-vusonly.png&#34; alt=&#34;The number of virtual users over time during a load test, as graphed in k6&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The number of virtual users over time during a load test, as graphed in k6&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ramp up is a period of time during which virtual users are gradually added, usually at the start of the test, and ramp down is when they are gradually stopped. For most applications, ramps are more realistic than all users clicking a link at exactly the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;setting-failure-criteria&#34;&gt;Setting failure criteria&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of simulating real users is determining what constitutes failures in user experience. You can incorporate failure criteria into scripts by adding response verifications, checks, and thresholds (such as those for response time or error rate). Building these into the script is a good practice to get into, because it defines the limits of acceptable performance from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suggestions in this section are for general use, but there are many situations where taking the opposite approach would be more realistic. Spend some time thinking about what is &amp;ldquo;realistic&amp;rdquo; for your application and test scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For your reference, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gist.github.com/nicolevanderhoeven/fb74cd9769c8abf95eeb8765a49398cb&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s a k6 script&lt;/a&gt; that started from the basic script I showed earlier, but has been modified to be more realistic. That link includes a CSV file with login credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;executing-load-tests&#34;&gt;Executing load tests&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of writing the test script, you probably would have already executed small verification tests, called shakeout tests. It&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to start with these shakeout tests on a new environment to make sure that both your test artifacts (your script and any other data files) and the environment are ready for full testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;running-the-test&#34;&gt;Running the test&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve been following along with the k6 script so far, all you need to do to run a load test is to execute the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;k6 run test.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This command will run the k6 script according to the test parameters set within it. The test will be executed locally. This is best used for shakeout tests, or if you prefer to run your load test on your own infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;realism-in-test-execution&#34;&gt;Realism in test execution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way can make executing load tests realistic is by matching the location of load generators to the physical location of your users. When you run a load test on machines in your data center, in the same network as your application servers, you will likely see response times that are significantly faster than your users would see. These false positives can look good on the report, but they don&amp;rsquo;t help you measure real user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running on the cloud is an easy way to make tests more realistic, especially if most of your end users are external to your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re following along with the k6 script, you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.k6.io/account/register&#34;&gt;sign up for an account&lt;/a&gt; with k6 Cloud (the first 50 tests are free). Since k6 itself is open source, you can also run it on your own cloud infrastructure, but using k6 Cloud is the most convenient way to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have an account, &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.k6.io/account/api-token&#34;&gt;copy your API token from here&lt;/a&gt;. Then, run this command in your terminal to give your local k6 installation permission to run on your account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;k6 login cloud --token &amp;lt;YOUR_K6_CLOUD_API_TOKEN&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you are successfully authenticated, you can continue to run tests locally using &lt;code&gt;k6 run&lt;/code&gt;, but you now have the option of running on the cloud as well:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;k6 cloud test.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 will then begin to execute your load test, and you&amp;rsquo;ll see a screen like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/k6-cloud-run-output.png&#34; alt=&#34;Running a k6 test on the cloud&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the &lt;code&gt;execution&lt;/code&gt; mode is now &lt;code&gt;cloud&lt;/code&gt;, to remind you where you&amp;rsquo;re running the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default, your test will run on the k6 AWS account, in the Ashburn region. However, you can override this and specify other regions, including percentages of your virtual user to run on each, using &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/cloud/creating-and-running-a-test/cloud-tests-from-the-cli#cloud-execution-options&#34;&gt;cloud execution options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;analyzing-load-testing-results-and-reporting&#34;&gt;Analyzing load testing results and reporting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;rsquo;m listing analysis as a different step in the process from execution, the two often (and should) overlap. The output from k6 in the screenshot above contains a link to the dashboard on k6 Cloud, so that you can see the results of the test in real time, as the test is running. Monitoring the test in real time lets you immediately spot issues as they arise, and, if necessary, stop the test to fix them. If the test is being executed by multiple load generators, having a consolidated dashboard is helpful in giving you an overview of the entire test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![An example of the results after a load test in k6 Cloud](/assets/Finished k6 run.png)
&lt;em&gt;An example of the results after a load test in k6 Cloud&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also a good time to monitor the health of the application servers and the load generator servers, which you set up monitoring tools for during the planning phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A load test is only useful when it&amp;rsquo;s providing information about the application. If errors occur in large quantities, or if the response time makes it clear that a certain component has failed to handle the load, don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid to stop the test. Your objective is to get the information you need to suggest performance improvements and solutions for any bottlenecks you find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Often, you&amp;rsquo;ll run into issues you can&amp;rsquo;t solve or even identify during a test. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s useful to explore the data that you have after a test. k6 lets you create shareable links to dashboards so that you can involve relevant engineering teams who may be able to help you understand what happened and why. &lt;a href=&#34;https://app.k6.io/runs/public/f6ad87cec7a24a8c82e46c816e67c4b3&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of what that dashboard looks like&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some projects require formal documentation of test execution by way of a Test Summary Report, but in more agile teams, it may be enough to share the test results dashboard and some supplementary information about what type of tests were run and what problems were encountered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important part of load testing isn&amp;rsquo;t the execution itself; it&amp;rsquo;s what you do with the results. Communicating results clearly to stakeholders will make it more likely that performance issues are fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-next&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phases I&amp;rsquo;ve outlined here are a good guide for anyone starting with load testing, but I always recommend that you take what works for your situation and leave the rest. In reality, the phases overlap with each other considerably, especially in more modern engineering cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another activity I&amp;rsquo;ve not covered here, but one that I recommend, is adding load testing to your CI/CD pipeline. This continuous testing approach involves &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/testing-guides/automated-performance-testing/&#34;&gt;automating load testing&lt;/a&gt; so that it occurs in regularly, in parallel with other development and testing activities. Continuous testing is a great way to get more value out of load testing, and it ensures that performance is front-of-mind for everyone on the application team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy testing!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I Use Obsidian at Work</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210518-how-i-use-obsidian-at-work/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 May 2021 22:33:18 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210518-how-i-use-obsidian-at-work/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Note-taking and personal knowledge management get talked about in academic circles, by both students and teachers. But there&amp;rsquo;s not much said about its use outside of the academe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/graphview-transparent.png&#34; alt=&#34;Obsidian for work&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll admit, due to my job description, I may be in a better position than most to take advantage of note-taking in a professional context. My background is in software performance testing. My job for several years has been to make sure that applications are prepared to withstand traffic from many users accessing it, usually by writing code to simulate that traffic before it&amp;rsquo;s released to real users. Currently, though, I&amp;rsquo;m a Developer Advocate at &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io&#34;&gt;k6.io&lt;/a&gt;, which means a significant part of my job now is sharing with people what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consider myself a knowledge worker: a significant part of my job depends on how quickly I learn new technologies &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; how clearly I can impart what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to others. I&amp;rsquo;d argue, though, that most people who work in a field as fast-moving as tech are knowledge workers too. It&amp;rsquo;s naive to think we won&amp;rsquo;t one day forget some skills we&amp;rsquo;ve learned, even if we were using them daily at one point. Yet nobody talks about note-taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, my note-taking and personal knowledge management tool of choice has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian.md&lt;/a&gt;. I have no affiliation with the Obsidian team, and in fact I&amp;rsquo;m an investor of &lt;a href=&#34;https://roamresearch.com&#34;&gt;a competing product&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some ways I use Obsidian at work that might help you understand why Obsidian is my daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-setup&#34;&gt;My setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have multiple Obsidian vaults, and each of them is a version-controlled &lt;a href=&#34;https://git-scm.com/&#34;&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt; repository, hosted on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I keep my main Obsidian vault in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://dropbox.com&#34;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt; for extra version control and as a backup. Just for overkill, I also use &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md/sync&#34;&gt;Obsidian Sync&lt;/a&gt; as another backup and as the easiest way to get access to my Obsidian vault on my iPad Pro and my Android mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md/publish&#34;&gt;Obsidian Publish&lt;/a&gt; to make some of my notes &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com&#34;&gt;publicly available&lt;/a&gt; on a custom domain directly from my vault, as an experiment in learning in public that&amp;rsquo;s gone pretty well so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This setup isn&amp;rsquo;t free. All up, I&amp;rsquo;m giving Obsidian about US $16 a month. However, I want to point out that Obsidian itself is free for personal use, and if mobile access, cloud sync, and publishing your notes online aren&amp;rsquo;t important to you, you can really go a long way with using it for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;processing-information&#34;&gt;Processing information&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remaining relevant in tech pretty much requires that you learn a lot, learn quickly, and enjoy the hell out of it. Luckily, Obsidian is pretty great at this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;consume-and-collect&#34;&gt;Consume and collect&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I consume a lot of content, and in different formats: articles, books, videos, presentations, podcasts are all great sources of free education. I initially capture my notes on them in different ways, but they all lead back to using &lt;a href=&#34;https://readwise.io/&#34;&gt;Readwise&lt;/a&gt;, which I use as a collector and sorter of all these notes. Then, I import data from Readwise to Obsidian using a process I describe in more detail &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210206-readwise-to-obsidian/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, suffice it to say that all these notes and highlights end up in Obsidian for processing. &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Presentation/In+the+kitchen+-+a+sprinkle+of+fire+and+chaos&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of my notes during a presentation&lt;/a&gt; (called &lt;em&gt;In the kitchen - a sprinkle of fire and chaos&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.anammedina.com/&#34;&gt;Ana Medina&lt;/a&gt;, about chaos engineering).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When trying to learn something, many people stop at this phase. They&amp;rsquo;ve read the thing, they&amp;rsquo;ve highlighted passages from the thing, and now they think they&amp;rsquo;ve learned the thing. That hasn&amp;rsquo;t been my experience, because I forget many things I consume shallowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;process-iteratively&#34;&gt;Process iteratively&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I process notes iteratively, first restating things into my own words and then creating my own notes about concepts I&amp;rsquo;ve learned. Each time I do that, I try to identify key concepts and create backlinks for them, which in Obsidian just means typing &lt;code&gt;[[Chaos engineering]]&lt;/code&gt;, with a topic between double brackets. If I click on that new link, it creates  a page for it. Over time, I end up with a page &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Chaos+Engineering&#34;&gt;like this one on Chaos Engineering&lt;/a&gt; that is a consolidation of what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, if I go to the Chaos Engineering page, I can also see all the instances I&amp;rsquo;ve linked to it from other notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/linked-mentions.png&#34; alt=&#34;Linked mentions in Obsidian&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the foresight to link to Chaos Engineering from an article I read? Obsidian also tracks &lt;em&gt;unlinked&lt;/em&gt; mentions as well. I can see all the times I&amp;rsquo;ve used the words &amp;ldquo;chaos engineering&amp;rdquo; in other notes, even if I haven&amp;rsquo;t created formal links using &lt;code&gt;[[Chaos engineering]]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, things I&amp;rsquo;m interested in start to emerge this way, and topics grow deeper and more detailed, with branches of pages spinning off from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;situate-and-solidify&#34;&gt;Situate and solidify&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I try to think about where this new piece of knowledge fits into the hierarchy of things I&amp;rsquo;m interested in. This is less about trying to classify the world and more about putting it somewhere on &lt;em&gt;my personal&lt;/em&gt; map of interests so that I&amp;rsquo;m more likely to use that knowledge later. For me, chaos engineering fit into my page on &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Nonfunctional+testing&#34;&gt;Nonfunctional testing&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so helps me pit it against other things I&amp;rsquo;ve classified as forms of nonfunctional testing and think critically about whether it belongs there, or whether other things I already know contradict it in some way. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;ll make notes about my reasoning for classification, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Chaos+engineering+is+a+testing+discipline&#34;&gt;this note on why I think chaos engineering is a testing discipline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of this is set in stone. I&amp;rsquo;m always changing notes around as I learn more things that change my mind. For example, I&amp;rsquo;m considering merging my nonfunctional testing and functional testing pages after a conversation where someone questioned whether it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a misnomer to call application performance &amp;ldquo;nonfunctional&amp;rdquo;. The point is to create a living, breathing second brain that helps me make connections between concepts and remember what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s built-in graph view illustrates this point nicely:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/graph_view-20210518.png&#34; alt=&#34;Built-in graph view&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my main Obsidian vault as of the time of this writing - all 5443 notes of it. The graph view plots every note and the connections between notes, so I&amp;rsquo;ve ended up with a slick visual representation of what I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking and writing about. The graph view is actually &lt;em&gt;functional&lt;/em&gt;, too&amp;ndash; I can assign colors to nodes based on the directory they&amp;rsquo;re in, their tags, words they can contain, and a lot of other criteria. Because each node is sized according to how many links lead to it, this view makes it easy to see clusters in things I&amp;rsquo;ve thought or written about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;publish&#34;&gt;Publish&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the advantages of Obsidian over something like Notion or Roam Research is how easy it is to publish notes from it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;obsidian-publish-paid&#34;&gt;Obsidian Publish (paid)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s the paid Publish service, which I&amp;rsquo;ve subscribed to for US $8 a month. After &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/Using+a+custom+domain+with+Obsidian+Publish&#34;&gt;setting it up to publish on my own domain&lt;/a&gt; rather than the default at &lt;code&gt;publish.obsidian.md&lt;/code&gt;, going from a note to a published post is as easy as clicking the Publish icon, selecting the notes to add, delete, or modify, and then selecting Publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/publish-dialog.png&#34; alt=&#34;Dialog for Obsidian Publish&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;open-folder-as-vault&#34;&gt;Open folder as vault&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to pay for Publish, Obsidian still saves all files locally in Markdown (&lt;code&gt;.md&lt;/code&gt;) format. This is the same format that many static site generators take for content. This site that you&amp;rsquo;re reading this on is generated using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, so everything written here is kept as a Markdown file before it&amp;rsquo;s turned into HTML. Since an &amp;ldquo;Obsidian vault&amp;rdquo; is just a folder with Markdown files, I can just open the directory containing the files for my site and write blog posts in Obsidian with no noticeable difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, we happen to store our main &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/&#34;&gt;product documentation&lt;/a&gt; as Markdown files in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/k6io/docs&#34;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;, which make it perfect for opening in Obsidian as well. I prefer to write documentation in Obsidian over VSCode for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can install plugins, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tgrosinger/advanced-tables-obsidian&#34;&gt;Advanced Tables&lt;/a&gt; to make Markdown tables easier to deal with, create templates to standardize the format of notes you make often, see an outline of what you&amp;rsquo;re writing based on Markdown headings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/outlines-obsidian.png&#34; alt=&#34;See an outline of your current note&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Outline core plugin for Obsidian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When I want to link to another page, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to just hit CMD + O to search through existing notes instead of finding it on GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I can choose an Obsidian theme that matches the theme of the published site. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ishgunacar/gitsidian&#34;&gt;This &amp;ldquo;Gitsidian&amp;rdquo; theme&lt;/a&gt; has an Edit view in dark mode (my preference) but a rendered Preview mode that looks more like GitHub&amp;rsquo;s Markdown format, so I can see what it will actually look like for users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/ishgunacar/gitsidian/raw/master/showcase.png&#34; alt=&#34;Gitsidian theme preview for Obsidian&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m done, I can still jump to my terminal and push my change to GitHub as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;obsidian-uris&#34;&gt;Obsidian URIs&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another cool feature is the fact that every note in Obsidian has what&amp;rsquo;s called an Obsidian URI - it&amp;rsquo;s a link that opens up a note within a specified vault. The URI looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;obsidian://open?vault=docs&amp;amp;file=src%2Fdata%2Fmarkdown%2Fdocs%2F03%20cloud%2F02%20Analyzing%20Results%2F02%20Performance%20Insights&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding it and publishing that to internal documentation means I can switch easily from browsing on GitHub to modifying the same page in Obsidian on my local machine, which is a great little bonus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;embedding-published-work&#34;&gt;Embedding published work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After publishing, I use iframes in Obsidian to update my notes with the final result. Here&amp;rsquo;s a video on YouTube about chaos engineering that my colleague &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; and I planned out collaboratively on Obsidian, embedded into Obsidian:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/embedded-youtube-iframe.png&#34; alt=&#34;Embedding a video in an iframe&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video plays in Obsidian with all the same controls. The Obsidian desktop app is an Electron app, so it behaves just like a normal browser for playing back the video. To embed the video, I just used the Share &amp;gt; Embed code on YouTube and pasted it straight into Obsidian:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-html&#34; data-lang=&#34;html&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;iframe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;560&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;315&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gVwJZPo30rk&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;YouTube video player&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;frameborder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;0&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;allow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;allowfullscreen&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;iframe&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;meetings&#34;&gt;Meetings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I take meeting notes to help me focus on the meeting, and I create templates for recurring meetings. Templates let you define the format of a note. Once created, you can insert templates into notes with a keyboard shortcut (I set mine to &lt;code&gt;CMD + ;&lt;/code&gt;). Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of what that looks like, with the template on the left and the inserted template on the right:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-meeting-templates.png&#34; alt=&#34;Template (left) and inserted template in a new note (right) in Obsidian&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Template (left) and inserted template in a new note (right) in Obsidian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may notice that the frontmatter includes &lt;code&gt;{{date}}&lt;/code&gt; in the template, which gets automatically converted to today&amp;rsquo;s date when the template is used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone asks for a copy of my meeting notes, that&amp;rsquo;s no problem&amp;ndash; any note can be exported to Obsidian by clicking on Options &amp;gt; Export to PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-pdf-export.png&#34; alt=&#34;Options for exporting a note to a PDF in Obsidian&#34;&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Options for exporting a note to a PDF in Obsidian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to actually publish any real meeting notes, so here&amp;rsquo;s what my note on the chaos engineering process looks like &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/assets/The%20process%20of%20chaos%20engineering.pdf&#34;&gt;as a PDF&lt;/a&gt;, straight from Obsidian. And here&amp;rsquo;s what it looks like &lt;a href=&#34;https://notes.nicolevanderhoeven.com/The+process+of+chaos+engineering&#34;&gt;as a note&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;presentations&#34;&gt;Presentations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-easier-way&#34;&gt;The easier way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian has a presentation mode! It&amp;rsquo;s basic, but it&amp;rsquo;s functional. You can create a presentation really easily by adding &lt;code&gt;---&lt;/code&gt; between paragraphs of text to delineate slides, right within a note. Here&amp;rsquo;s what that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-slides-markdown.png&#34; alt=&#34;Creating a presentation from Markdown notes&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you can click Options &amp;gt; Start presentation, and you get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-slides.png&#34; alt=&#34;An Obsidian presentation&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A little plain, but given the minimal amount of effort to &amp;ldquo;convert&amp;rdquo; a note into a presentation, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-harder-way&#34;&gt;The harder way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the basic slides just don&amp;rsquo;t cut it, and it can be handy to be able to publish the slides in presentation format (since publishing them straight from Obsidian Publish would only publish the Markdown version). For those cases, I&amp;rsquo;ve figured out a way to do just that while still keeping my slides as Markdown files in my vault. &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.com/blog/20210302-presentation-slides-as-code/&#34;&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a whole post on how to do that&lt;/a&gt;. This is definitely more complicated, but at the end of it, you get a nice page &lt;a href=&#34;https://slides.nicolevanderhoeven.com/2021-load-tests-as-code/#/&#34;&gt;like this&lt;/a&gt; to send to attendees after a presentation. (&lt;em&gt;Tip: Hit &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; to see the speaker notes while on those slides.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/20210302-reveal-hugo-sample.png&#34; alt=&#34;A sample custom slide using revealJS with Obsidian&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;task-management&#34;&gt;Task management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use a few community plugins to keep track of things I want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;kanban&#34;&gt;Kanban&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-kanban&#34;&gt;Kanban plugin&lt;/a&gt; turns Markdown task lists into full-on Kanban boards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-kanban.png&#34; alt=&#34;Kanban plugin in action&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the left is the markdown note, and the on the right is the rendered Kanban board. You can customize the titles of the lists that are there, and you can add due dates to each task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;calendar&#34;&gt;Calendar&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-calendar-plugin&#34;&gt;Calendar plugin&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fo6BKY2xR2w&#34;&gt;Obsidian&amp;rsquo;s most popular plugin&lt;/a&gt;, and with good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It lets me add a calendar on the sidebar:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-calendar.png&#34; alt=&#34;Obsidian calendar&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the weekly notes option enabled, so clicking on the &lt;code&gt;W&lt;/code&gt; column in the calendar takes me to a note that is automatically created for that week. I use it to keep track of weekly goals and to do a review at the end of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking on a date in the calendar takes me to the&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;daily-note&#34;&gt;Daily Note&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Daily Notes core plugin comes with Obsidian, but you have to enable it. Once enabled, clicking on a day in the calendar creates/takes you to that day&amp;rsquo;s corresponding note. I use daily notes like a log or workbench for that day, with timestamped headings to help me remember later on what I did at what time. It&amp;rsquo;s a loose way to do time management as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dataview&#34;&gt;Dataview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview&#34;&gt;Dataview plugin&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite recent discovery, and it&amp;rsquo;s changing the way I do frontmatter. This plugin brings something akin to SQL (albeit not as powerful) to Obsidian. It lets you query your notes based on some file-related metadata &lt;strong&gt;as well as parameters you set in your frontmatter&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, this query:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-dataview&#34; data-lang=&#34;dataview&#34;&gt;table file.ctime as Date
from &amp;quot;Meeting&amp;quot;
where file.ctime &amp;gt;= date(today) -dur(1 month)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;when rendered (i.e., viewed in Preview mode in Obsidian), returns a list of all my notes under the subfolder &lt;code&gt;Meeting&lt;/code&gt; in the last month:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/obsidian-dataview-meetings.png&#34; alt=&#34;Obsidian Dataview results as a table&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is huge! I&amp;rsquo;m still updating my notes with the appropriate frontmatter to make more use of this feature, but here are some use cases I can think of that would be handy at work:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find all customers with tag &lt;code&gt;annual&lt;/code&gt; that I haven&amp;rsquo;t spoken to in the last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find a load testing tool with feature &lt;code&gt;Slack_integration = true&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find that woman I met at the Automation Test Guild conference by searching for &lt;code&gt;job = tester&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tag = AutomationTestGuild&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Return all notes tagged &lt;code&gt;#plugin_ideas&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s just the beginning!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;collaboration&#34;&gt;Collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obsidian itself does not (yet) have collaboration features. This is a bummer, but given how quickly they&amp;rsquo;ve delivered on features that the community has clamored for (block references and mobile apps come immediately to mind), I&amp;rsquo;m hopeful that they&amp;rsquo;ll eventually improve in this area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, I&amp;rsquo;ve still found ways to work on the same vault with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember how any folder of .md files can be opened as an Obsidian vault? Well, I&amp;rsquo;m technically collaborating with other people on that repo for work documentation, even if most people don&amp;rsquo;t use Obsidian. All I had to do was add the &lt;code&gt;.obsidian&lt;/code&gt; directory to the &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file, and now, nobody really even needs to know I&amp;rsquo;m using Obsidian to view/edit the documentation. They just see me pushing to the repository as if I had used a text editor like VSCode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve also had the experience of collaborating with someone who also used Obsidian. Since we were working closely together on the same document, we opted to put our shared vault on Dropbox. Dropbox&amp;rsquo;s main advantage over the Git solution is that Dropbox let us edit notes and see each other&amp;rsquo;s edits in real time. If you&amp;rsquo;re looking for an experience similar to Google Docs, this way got the closest to that. We did run into some quirks: if the Dropbox vault is also a Git repository, be aware that checking out a different branch will also change the contents of the directory for the other person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note-taking and personal management aren&amp;rsquo;t just for students and teachers; I think they&amp;rsquo;re particularly useful in tech, where knowledge work is highly prized. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about Obsidian because that&amp;rsquo;s my current tool of choice, but I think the tool you use is less important than the systems you put in place to help yourself learn and create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;d prefer the video version, here&amp;rsquo;s a video I made showing this process:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We were happy to welcome &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/serverlessmom&#34;&gt;Nočnica Fee&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitch.tv/new_relic&#34;&gt;New Relic&lt;/a&gt; to k6 Office Hours. She very bravely volunteered to learn how to use k6&amp;ndash; live! Talk about pressure. But she handled it like a champ!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also talked about why observability is both particularly important and particularly difficult in serverless architecture. There will definitely be a part two at some point!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We managed to get two other folks from k6 to join our Office Hours: our CEO, Robin Gustafsson, and our Head of Customer Success, Mark Meier. We took advantage of the opportunity to discuss wishlist features for k6 and bug Robin about how likely each feature was to see the light of day!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning more about chaos engineering. In this week&amp;rsquo;s k6 Office Hours, I shared my experience as a tester getting started with Kubernetes, chaos engineering with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/simskij/xk6-chaos&#34;&gt;xk6-chaos&lt;/a&gt; and k6, and observability with &lt;a href=&#34;https://newrelic.com&#34;&gt;New Relic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This must be the month for trying new things, because I jumped into livestreaming with the first ever &lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210205-k6-office-hours&#34;&gt;k6 Office Hours&lt;/a&gt; just a week ago, and this week I&amp;rsquo;m jumping into podcasting with &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme Aronsson&lt;/a&gt;, who&amp;rsquo;s also doing the Office Hours with me. There&amp;rsquo;s definitely safety (at least psychological safety) in numbers, because doing it with someone else makes me feel a little more brave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the podcast is presented by &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io&#34;&gt;k6&lt;/a&gt;, that&amp;rsquo;s really just a fancy term for saying that we&amp;rsquo;re both employed by k6 and we&amp;rsquo;re recording and producing the podcast on company time. Unlike the Office Hours, which is heavily k6-focused, the podcast will be about software performance and reliability in general. Simme and I happen to have different and complementary skillsets (he comes from a developer background, and I come from a testing background, and I think that makes for an interesting combination of perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s the first episode! It should also be available on your audio podcasting tool of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The first ever k6 Office Hours</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20210205-k6-office-hours/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The k6 virtual office is open!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time I heard about office hours was from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.notion.so/&#34;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;. Recently, &lt;a href=&#34;https://obsidian.md&#34;&gt;Obsidian&lt;/a&gt; went in on this trend as well. The concept involves opening your virtual doors regularly to your community, to answer questions and share best practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A big part of being a Developer Advocate is talking &lt;em&gt;to&lt;/em&gt; people, and even conferences these days are mostly pre-recorded. I kind of miss being able to interact &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; people. I miss the immediacy of &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt;. So I talked &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme Aronsson&lt;/a&gt; into doing a k6 Office Hours with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re both new to livestreaming, so there&amp;rsquo;s a lot that we&amp;rsquo;ve learned and will be improving in future videos, but here&amp;rsquo;s our first attempt!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcYeboT5FYE&amp;amp;list=PLJdv3RhAQXNHsC8OOV3ZjwZvC9tRoAYF2&#34;&gt;joined the k6 team in late November&lt;/a&gt;, the foremost question on my mind was &amp;ldquo;How does this compare to JMeter?&amp;rdquo; You see, I come from a performance testing consulting background, and in the last few years, JMeter has been far and away my tool of choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what am I doing on the k6 site, talking about how much I love JMeter? Well, firstly, it turns out that the k6 team is pretty open and transparent, especially about potential improvements in k6. Secondly, I want to share my reasons for wanting to explore k6 as a load testing tool&amp;ndash; the same reasons that ultimately convinced me to join the team that builds it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-jmeter&#34;&gt;What is JMeter?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org/&#34;&gt;JMeter&lt;/a&gt; is an open source load testing tool built entirely in Java by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.apache.org/&#34;&gt;Apache Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. It was first released in 1998, and it made waves because of its audacity in taking on more popular but proprietary load testing tools. JMeter took what other companies were charging a lot of money for and published it online for everyone to use&amp;ndash; for free. Although scripts can also be extended using code, majority of the scripting in JMeter is done using the UI. At the time of this writing, the latest version of JMeter is 5.4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-k6&#34;&gt;What is k6?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/loadimpact/k6&#34;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; load testing tool released by &lt;a href=&#34;https://loadimpact.com&#34;&gt;LoadImpact&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. LoadImpact had previously consisted of the SaaS platform (now &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/cloud&#34;&gt;k6 Cloud&lt;/a&gt;) and professional services. k6 is written in Go, but scripts are written in Javascript. Taking the opposite tack to JMeter, k6&amp;rsquo;s main selling point is its code-based scripting and heavy prioritization of the developer experience. The latest version of k6 is 0.30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;which-is-better&#34;&gt;Which is better?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article isn&amp;rsquo;t about which tool is &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;, because as much as we might prefer a clear-cut answer, there&amp;rsquo;s no &amp;ldquo;best tool&amp;rdquo;. Everything depends on the situation your team is in: what, how, why, and when you&amp;rsquo;re testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question that I want to answer here is: &lt;em&gt;What situations does each tool excel in?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;when-does-jmeter-excel&#34;&gt;When does JMeter excel?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-you-want-to-get-started-quickly&#34;&gt;When you want to get started quickly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jmeter-has-a-gui&#34;&gt;JMeter has a GUI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many testing teams make decisions on load testing tools based on this fact alone. Sometimes, if you&amp;rsquo;re in a situation where people haven&amp;rsquo;t done load testing before and need to learn a new tool, a GUI-driven tool like JMeter is simply the most frictionless option. A tool with a GUI will be less daunting for many testers that are used to the mostly no-code UIs of the likes of Postman or SOAPUI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/01-jmetergui.png&#34; alt=&#34;JMeter&amp;rsquo;s starting screen: a fresh new test plan&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought of JMeter as user-friendly, but a developer friend recently pointed out that the Test Plan screen that greets you when you first start JMeter doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide any indication of how to create an HTTP sampler. None of the icons add elements to the test plan. It takes a bit of exploring to realize that right clicking on the test plan, or going to Edit &amp;gt; Add, will show the &amp;ldquo;Add&amp;rdquo; menu that you need. He has a point there: UI is subjective to a certain degree. However, I&amp;rsquo;d argue that it&amp;rsquo;s definitely easier for non-developers to explore a UI than a bit of code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a GUI packaged within the tool, but the &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/test-authoring/test-builder&#34;&gt;k6 Test Builder&lt;/a&gt; is available for free. It&amp;rsquo;s a way to create tests with a GUI interface, and despite its inclusion in k6 cloud, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any subscription to use. However, it isn&amp;rsquo;t as fully-featured as JMeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;jmeter-supports-many-protocols-and-features-out-of-the-box&#34;&gt;JMeter supports many protocols and features out of the box&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org/index.html&#34;&gt;the official list&lt;/a&gt; of the protocols that JMeter supports:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web - HTTP, HTTPS (Java, NodeJS, PHP, ASP.NET, …)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SOAP / REST Webservices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FTP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Database via JDBC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;LDAP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Message-oriented middleware (MOM) via JMS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mail - SMTP(S), POP3(S) and IMAP(S)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Native commands or shell scripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TCP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Java Objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, k6 supports the following protocols:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web - HTTP/1.1, &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/protocols/http-2&#34;&gt;HTTP/2&lt;/a&gt; (Java, NodeJS, PHP, ASP.NET, …)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/protocols/websockets&#34;&gt;WebSockets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/protocols/grpc&#34;&gt;gRPC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SOAP / REST Webservices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protocols above are those that are natively supported. However, both tools allow the development of third-party plugins, adding support for more protocols. The number of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/topics/xk6&#34;&gt;k6 community extensions&lt;/a&gt;, through &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/blog/extending-k6-with-xk6&#34;&gt;xk6&lt;/a&gt;, is growing, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter-plugins.org/&#34;&gt;JMeter plugins&lt;/a&gt; still outnumber them. In many cases, the protocols your application uses may make the decision for you of which tool to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMeter also has most of the features you&amp;rsquo;ll need for a basic load test, and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to code any of it up yourself. Its parent-child element structure means that you can modify a specific element, like an HTTP request, or modify all HTTP requests, with equal ease. Adding think time to all requests is as easy as adding a Uniform Random Timer to your thread group, and all requests within that group will inherit it.
With code-based load testing tools, it can be a bit more difficult to find out what&amp;rsquo;s possible without a UI. Some of the gap, however, can be bridged by an IDE with good autocompletion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-you-want-a-mature-community-with-tons-of-documentation&#34;&gt;When you want a mature community with tons of documentation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMeter&amp;rsquo;s old, and sometimes that&amp;rsquo;s a good thing. It&amp;rsquo;s been around since 1998, so at this point, it&amp;rsquo;s had 22 years to improve and to build a following. JMeter has a presence on nearly every community networking site, and no matter how specific your use case for JMeter is, the chances are that it&amp;rsquo;s been done before. Searching &amp;ldquo;how to load test X with JMeter&amp;rdquo; is bound to yield thousands of hits and some videos showing you exactly how to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMeter&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/component_reference.html&#34;&gt;Component Reference&lt;/a&gt; is proof of JMeter&amp;rsquo;s extensive and thorough documentation. Every element, function, and property is discussed in more detail than most people could ever want, and that&amp;rsquo;s just the &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; documentation that&amp;rsquo;s on the Apache site. There are thousands of JMeter books, tutorials, and courses by its passionate users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apache/jmeter&#34;&gt;JMeter GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; has 17,290 commits as of December 2020 - evidence of a community of developers that have committed some time and experience to JMeter over the last two decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison, the k6 community is growing, but still small. There is an official and &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.k6.io/&#34;&gt;central community forum&lt;/a&gt; that allows users to share their experiences with k6, which is something missing from the JMeter community. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/loadimpact/k6&#34;&gt;k6 repository&lt;/a&gt; does have more stars, but significantly fewer commits at 3,795. Much of the disparity, of course, is because k6 is very new - the open-source tool k6 was only released in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-you-need-a-cost-effective-way-to-do-distributed-load-testing&#34;&gt;When you need a cost-effective way to do distributed load testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of JMeter&amp;rsquo;s absolute best features is that it gives you a framework for running distributed load tests with it. This is pretty special for a free and open-source tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distributed testing means ramping up the amount of load you&amp;rsquo;re generating with your load tests, usually by increasing the number of virtual users and running multiple instances of your script on other load generators. JMeter accomplishes this by designating a controller node and letting you set up worker nodes. Each worker node needs to have a copy of &lt;code&gt;jmeter-server&lt;/code&gt;, a utility included with every JMeter installation (in &lt;code&gt;jmeter/bin&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/02-jmeterdistributed.svg&#34; alt=&#34;JMeter comes with a native distributed testing mode&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/jmeter_distributed_testing_step_by_step.html&#34;&gt;Apache JMeter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These worker nodes then run copies of your test plan and exert load against your application server. You can use on-premise or cloud machines as your worker nodes. A distributed execution like this takes a bit to set up, but it does work surprisingly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a &lt;em&gt;native&lt;/em&gt; distributed load testing mode. You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; containerize it yourself and deploy it via Kubernetes, for instance, but it does require a more involved setup. The team is also working on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/k6io/operator&#34;&gt;k6 Operator&lt;/a&gt;, which makes setup significantly easier, but it is experimental and comes with drawbacks such as not supporting threshold synchronization between instances. For now, the easiest way to scale up on k6 is by using the paid service k6 Cloud, which reduces setup time and complexity significantly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to note that JMeter can be quite resource-hungry, and thus is more likely to require multiple load generators to generate load than k6. Depending on the resources of the load generator, JMeter can run about a thousand virtual users on average, and scaling up your test beyond that point will require a distributed execution setup. A single instance of k6, on the other hand, can run tens of thousands of virtual users given the same resources. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-you-want-canned-reports-built-into-your-load-testing-tool&#34;&gt;When you want canned reports built into your load testing tool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMeter&amp;rsquo;s many listeners allow you to decide exactly what format you want to view results in. Debugging? Use the View Results Tree. Wanting metrics for your load test? Use the Summary or Aggregate Report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/03-jmeterlistener.png&#34; alt=&#34;Adding listeners like View Results Tree in JMeter lets you visualize results in different ways&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, JMeter can generate HTML reports based on your load tests. They&amp;rsquo;re currently quite limited, but functional, and they have several default graphs to help you analyze your load test. They are not interactive, but they are pretty easy to generate and a good starting point for putting together a report template for your tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/04-jmeterhtmlreport.png&#34; alt=&#34;JMeter&amp;rsquo;s built-in HTML dashboard is limited but functional&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 does not have built-in reporting. Its modular nature lends itself better to integrating with &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/results-visualization&#34;&gt;many other data analytics tools&lt;/a&gt;, including Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, Amazon CloudWatch, and k6 Cloud&amp;ndash; all of which are better analysis tools and can provide more insights than what JMeter&amp;rsquo;s reports can provide, but they do require you to set up another tool to analyze your tests. If you&amp;rsquo;re running low on time and can make do with its reports, JMeter does really well at providing that extra value out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;when-does-k6-excel&#34;&gt;When does k6 excel?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-you-want-to-get-started-quickly-1&#34;&gt;When you want to get started quickly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yup, I put this one in both the JMeter and k6 sections. JMeter and k6 can each be easy to get started with, but for very different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;installation&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 installs extremely quickly - on my first installation of it on macOS, it took &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5tteMKZUqk&amp;amp;t=99&#34;&gt;7 seconds&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;code&gt;brew install k6&lt;/code&gt;. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t require nodeJS or any other dependencies, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMeter itself is fairly easy to install, but before you install JMeter, you need to install Java. Especially if you&amp;rsquo;re using Windows, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a rite of passage for a new JMeter user to run into issues adding the environment variables needed for Java to function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can also be confusing to determine which version of Java is the right one. There&amp;rsquo;s JDK, JRE, and recently Oracle has added to the confusion by announcing that some versions of Java (but not all) are going to require a license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/05-javalicense.png&#34; alt=&#34;Oracle&amp;rsquo;s changing Java licensing can cause confusion for JMeter users&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://java.com/en/download/&#34;&gt;Oracle Java&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While JMeter is still free via OpenJDK, I&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to a few testers who mistakenly thought they&amp;rsquo;d have to pay for JMeter. It&amp;rsquo;s a little disconcerting to see Oracle flexing its muscles here, especially if you&amp;rsquo;ve built a whole performance testing suite on Java through JMeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;plugins&#34;&gt;Plugins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/blog/extending-k6-with-xk6&#34;&gt;supports plugins&lt;/a&gt;, but they&amp;rsquo;re not necessary. For most use cases, k6&amp;rsquo;s built-in functionality should be more than sufficient. This is in sharp contrast to JMeter, where everything is a plugin &amp;hellip; even the &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter-plugins.org/wiki/PluginsManager/&#34;&gt;Plugin Manager&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most JMeter users would argue that there is a standard set of plugins that you should download before you even begin to use it. A new JMeter user might not necessarily know where to find these and may have a less-than-satisfying experience out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few things you &lt;em&gt;won&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; have if you stick to a vanilla, no-plugin JMeter installation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thread groups: No custom load profile, stages, rendezvous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controllers: No parallel controller to execute requests in parallel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Samplers: No HTTP/2 support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test Data: No randomization of lines within a CSV file (sequential only)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timers: No throughput shaping timer for setting throughput in stages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These functions are all available within k6 from the get-go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;scripting&#34;&gt;Scripting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 scripts are written in javascript, making them simple to write and run. All you need is one installer (on Microsoft Windows) or a single command on your terminal and any text editor. For JMeter, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to install a few things locally before you can get started: Java, JMeter itself, and the standard set of plugins you&amp;rsquo;ll need. This can be confusing for new users. Who hasn&amp;rsquo;t struggled with environment variables at some point when learning to use JMeter, especially on Windows?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also takes time to learn any new UI, whereas javascript is near-ubiquitous and it&amp;rsquo;s a good language to learn when you&amp;rsquo;re load testing web sites anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-you-want-to-maximize-performance-and-efficiency&#34;&gt;When you want to maximize performance and efficiency&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;test-your-test-tools&#34;&gt;Test your test tools!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does all this matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we&amp;rsquo;re talking about simulating many virtual users, slow performance = high cost. There is a cost to the number of load generators you use, whether it&amp;rsquo;s the cost to acquire and maintain them (on-prem) or the cost of a cloud service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It makes sense to consider the performance limitations of your load testing tool before you use it to improve your own application&amp;rsquo;s performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;k6-builds-on-gos-stellar-performance&#34;&gt;k6 builds on Go&amp;rsquo;s stellar performance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 is written in Go, and Go is built with performance in mind. &amp;ldquo;Go is a compiled language and does not need to be interpreted, unlike Java or Python. There is no added layer of complexity.&amp;rdquo; It also has no external dependencies, which is a good thing. Fewer moving parts for a performance tester means fewer potential sources of a bottleneck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The simplest and most common way for a load testing tool to run a virtual user is to assign one virtual user to one kernel or OS thread. However, the 1 Thread: 1 Virtual User paradigm has a serious flaw: when a virtual user is waiting for a response or executing a programmed &lt;code&gt;sleep()&lt;/code&gt;, the thread is also blocked, and cannot process other work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In k6, each virtual user is run on a goroutine, not a thread. What difference does that make? Well, goroutines can be controlled by something called the Go Scheduler, which acts like a traffic cop. It reuses idle threads and intelligently assigns work, by allowing &amp;ldquo;work stealing&amp;rdquo; and work hand-offs between threads. Does this sound familiar? This is the same principle that load balancers are built on: An external monitor that oversees the flow of work improves general performance. Go itself is intrinsically load-balanced in a way that many programming languages aren&amp;rsquo;t, which makes it the perfect foundation for a load testing tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to leverage Go&amp;rsquo;s innate performance optimizations also translates into significantly less memory utilization. One thread running k6 doesn&amp;rsquo;t go above 100 kb, whereas a JVM thread like JMeter uses, for instance, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.baeldung.com/jvm-configure-stack-sizes&#34;&gt;uses the default of 1MB&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s 1000% more than k6! Of course, Java allows a user to tweak an app&amp;rsquo;s memory utilization, so the difference is usually not quite as stark, but it&amp;rsquo;s still interesting to note that Go has a much lower starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip; creating [a] new thread in Java is not memory efficient. As every thread consumes approx 1MB of the memory heap size and eventually if you start spinning thousands of threads, they will put tremendous pressure on the heap and will cause shut down due to out of memory. Also, if you want to communicate between two or more threads, it’s very difficult. - &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@kevalpatel2106/why-should-you-learn-go-f607681fad65&#34;&gt;Keval Patel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;performance-benefits-in-practice&#34;&gt;Performance benefits in practice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fewer load generators needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6&amp;rsquo;s comparatively better performance means it needs fewer load generators to execute a given amount of load. Rafaela Azevedo made a comparison of the memory used by k6 and JMeter, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://azevedorafaela.com/2020/07/06/load-tests-jmeter-vs-k6/&#34;&gt;here are her results&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMeter took up 760 MB of memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, k6 took up 256 MB of memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rafaela&amp;rsquo;s findings are further affirmed by our own benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/08-internalbenchmarks.png&#34; alt=&#34;A comparison of maximum throughput and memory for the most popular open-source load testing tools&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Source: Ragnar Lönn, in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/blog/comparing-best-open-source-load-testing-tools&#34;&gt;Load Testing Tool Comparison&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6&amp;rsquo;s lower memory footprint is the reason it can run more virtual users and generate more load than average. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re using load generators that are on-premise or in a cloud, you&amp;rsquo;ll pay less for provisioning costs when using k6. This cost saving makes k6 a great tool for budget-conscious teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common misconception of many load testers is that distributed execution (ability to launch a load test on multiple machines) is required to generate large load. This is not the case with k6. - &lt;a href=&#34;https://azevedorafaela.com/2020/07/06/load-tests-jmeter-vs-k6/&#34;&gt;Rafaela Azevedo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 is different from many other load testing tools in the way it handles hardware resources. A single k6 process will efficiently use all CPU cores on a load generator machine. A single instance of k6 is often enough to generate load of 30.000-40.000 simultaneous users (VUs). This amount of VUs can generate upwards of 300,000 requests per second (RPS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unless you need more than 100,000-300,000 requests per second (6-12M requests per minute), a single instance of k6 will likely be sufficient for your needs. - &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/testing-guides/running-large-tests&#34;&gt;k6 documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No out of memory errors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 is also good for when you&amp;rsquo;re short on time. Using JMeter means getting familiar with how to performance tune Java and how to fix the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.eginnovations.com/blog/top-10-java-performance-problems/&#34;&gt;most common Java performance problems&lt;/a&gt;, because there are several. The one that I&amp;rsquo;ve personally run into the most while using JMeter is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;ERROR - jmeter.threads.JMeterThread: Test failed! java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: 
Java heap space. 
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re not really a JMeter load tester until you&amp;rsquo;ve seen this error. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause for this error is usually that there was an insufficient amount of Heap memory allocated to JMeter. Yup&amp;ndash; in addition to monitoring your load generator&amp;rsquo;s memory usage, you&amp;rsquo;ll also need to monitor the JVM&amp;rsquo;s memory usage. You can set the amount of heap memory allocated to JMeter by modifying the JMeter binary itself and changing this line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-java&#34; data-lang=&#34;java&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; This is the base heap size &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; you may increase or decrease it to fit your
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010&#34;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt; system&lt;span style=&#34;color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;s memory availability&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;${HEAP:=&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;Xms1g &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;Xmx1g &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;XX&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;MaxMetaspaceSize&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;256m&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;}&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even JMeter official documentation suggests that you increase the Java Heap size beyond 1GB before you even run your first load test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increase the Java Heap size. By default JMeter runs with a heap of 1 GB, this might not be enough for your test and depends on your test plan and number of threads you want to run - &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html&#34;&gt;Apache JMeter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No GUI means no resource overhead during load tests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GUIs typically add significantly more overhead to an application, which is one of the reasons why k6 doesn&amp;rsquo;t have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re running a load test, the best practice is to run it from the command line anyway&amp;ndash; because otherwise, it interferes with your results. Code-based load testing tools are performant from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMeter is peppered with warnings about the GUI&amp;rsquo;s effect on performance. Here&amp;rsquo;s one from the &amp;ldquo;JMeter documentation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t run load test using GUI mode ! - &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html&#34;&gt;Apache JMeter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s a message that occurs upon startup of JMeter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/09-jmeterguimodewarning.png&#34; alt=&#34;JMeter&amp;rsquo;s startup screen warns users not to use the GUI mode for load testing&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not having a GUI means there&amp;rsquo;s one less gotcha. Any load testing scripts you create in k6 are ready for prime-time execution whenever you&amp;rsquo;re ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-you-want-to-do-goal-oriented-testing&#34;&gt;When you want to do goal-oriented testing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important question a load tester can ask when starting a new load testing project is &amp;ldquo;Why&amp;rdquo;?
Test plans should be made to directly address a team&amp;rsquo;s reasons for wanting to do load testing, and that should be reflected in the non-functional requirements. Non-functional requirements, in turn, should then give some guidance as to the bounds of acceptable performance. A common example for these bounds, or thresholds, is an average response time of less than 3 seconds for all transactions during the test.
k6 does this natively with &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/thresholds&#34;&gt;global thresholds&lt;/a&gt; worked into the script, and you can also create your own metric to use in a threshold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;k6/http&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Rate&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;k6/metrics&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;myFailRate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;Rate&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;failed requests&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;);

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; {

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  },
};

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; () {

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/thresholds&#34;&gt;k6 documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMeter doesn&amp;rsquo;t natively support thresholds at the test-level. There are a few ways that I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to work around this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration Assertion&lt;/strong&gt;: You can add a Duration Assertion to any sampler in JMeter, which allows you set an acceptable response time for that request in milliseconds, beyond which the request (and the transaction that encompasses it) would be marked as failed. However, this is still just at the individual request level, and even putting the duration assertion element at the Test Plan level only applies the same threshold to each child request. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t constitute pass/fail criteria for the test as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Timers&lt;/strong&gt;: For criteria related to throughput, you can use the Constant Throughput Timer or the Throughput Shaping Timer (plugin). This approach controls how many requests per second are spent. In my experience, it&amp;rsquo;s worth testing how these timers behave when using nested transaction controllers - it may take some rearranging to get right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance Plugin&lt;/strong&gt;: When integrating JMeter with Jenkins, you can use the Performance Plugin to set error thresholds and mark test runs (&amp;ldquo;builds&amp;rdquo;) as unstable or failed within Jenkins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Custom Code&lt;/strong&gt;: You can use the JSR223 Sampler to write a bit of Groovy or BeanShell code that collects and parses response metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that even though these options make setting thresholds possible in JMeter, they&amp;rsquo;re still workarounds that don&amp;rsquo;t come with JMeter out of the box or don&amp;rsquo;t adequately address the creation of different types of thresholds (error, response time, throughput, CPU, memory). What I end up doing, more often than not, is exporting the raw data from JMeter and doing the analysis myself using another tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-youre-part-of-a-team-of-scripters&#34;&gt;When you&amp;rsquo;re part of a team of scripters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 shines in situations where more than one person could be doing the scripting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;it-strikes-a-middle-ground-that-developers-and-testers-can-compromise-on&#34;&gt;It strikes a middle ground that developers and testers can compromise on&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software quality should not be the sole responsibility of testers; quality should be baked into every activity when building software. One of the challenges in implementing this concept, however, is that there has traditionally been a segmentation in tools and languages used by team members with different functions. Developers use one tool; testers use another. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to encourage developers to test and testers to code in this environment, and many testing tools only further encourage this divide. A developer can&amp;rsquo;t use a tool like JMeter for anything but testing, so the incentive to invest the effort in learning it is lower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 bridges the gap by bringing testing concepts and features to an environment and language that developers are already spending their time in. Javascript is useful for more than just writing load testing scripts, and k6 works well with any IDE or text editor. A frictionless developer experience is central to the k6 philosophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;its-easier-to-collaborate-on-scripts&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easier to collaborate on scripts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve convinced both devs and testers to contribute to load testing scripts, how do you keep track of changes? How do you manage scripts that multiple people are working on at the same time?
With tests as code, the easiest way is to just use versioning tools like Git, the way you probably are already using for your application code. Again, no new framework or processes to learn here.
k6&amp;rsquo;s conciseness and portability really proves to be an advantage in collaboration situations. To illustrate this, let&amp;rsquo;s consider a simple test script that contains a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A GET request to &lt;a href=&#34;https://test.k6.io&#34;&gt;our test site&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;code&gt;https://test.k6.io&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A transaction that calls this request &lt;code&gt;01_Home&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A check to fail non-HTTP 200 responses or responses that don&amp;rsquo;t have the text &lt;code&gt;Collection of simple web-pages suitable for load testing&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Variable think time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll just run that as a single user, for a single iteration. Here&amp;rsquo;s what that script looks like in k6:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;k6/http&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;check&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;k6&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; () {

  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/hashTree&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;/jmeterTestPlan&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which one is easier to understand? If you had to modify the script to add a request, which format would you choose to do it in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scripting in XML makes merge conflicts more likely and breaking changes in automation pipelines way more difficult to pinpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve collaborated with others on JMeter scripts in the past, and we always opened up scripts in the GUI. It&amp;rsquo;s way easier to spot changes there - but that also created some new issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-you-want-something-easy-to-maintain&#34;&gt;When you want something easy to maintain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;versioning-for-load-testing&#34;&gt;Versioning for load testing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When ramping up load tests to more than one load generator, keeping track of the versions of necessary components ensures that one load generator&amp;rsquo;s traffic is the same as another&amp;rsquo;s. The value of reducing variables in scientific experiments holds true for load testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With k6, you just need to worry about the version of k6 and the script. No other dependencies are required. If you&amp;rsquo;re using plugins, you&amp;rsquo;d need to track those too, but as mentioned previously, plugins in k6 aren&amp;rsquo;t as necessary as they are in some other tools &amp;ndash; and k6 is available as a Docker image to reduce those issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With something like JMeter, there are more levels to consider. There&amp;rsquo;s the version of JMeter itself, Java, versions of plugins, and then the script. Every new layer introduces more changes for incompatibilities. In previous projets I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on, someone would inevitably try out a new plugin and forget to discuss it with the team, and anyone who tried to open that script in their copy of JMeter would see this error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/assets/10-jmeterpluginerror.png&#34; alt=&#34;This is the error that JMeter throws when you attempt to open a test plan that includes a plugin you don&amp;rsquo;t have installed locally&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error means there&amp;rsquo;s a plugin that the script uses that JMeter doesn&amp;rsquo;t recognize, but depending on the plugin, it&amp;rsquo;s not always this easy to pinpoint which one (it was the &lt;code&gt;Ultimate Thread Group&lt;/code&gt; in this case).
You don&amp;rsquo;t want that happening in the middle of your load test because you forgot to add a plugin to some of your load generators!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;its-easier-to-link-test-code-with-application-code&#34;&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s easier to link test code with application code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your application code is in Javascript, k6 is a shoo-in as a load testing tool. You could build tests that are tightly integrated with application code by importing objects and having your tests interacting with them directly. This approach would reduce a lot of time spent in refactoring test scripts when objects are changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re already using VS Code, k6 even has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=k6.k6&#34;&gt;VS Code plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;test-as-code-gives-you-control&#34;&gt;Test as code gives you control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having your scripts be pure code reduces ambiguities in that you&amp;rsquo;re not limited by poor UI design or bugs in third-party plugins. k6 scripts are Typescript-typed, so most IDEs support autocompletion while you&amp;rsquo;re scripting - the code equivalent of helpful tooltips, except way more universal.
k6 scripts give you the freedom to import and use JS libraries, so you can build on code others have already written. While k6 is not NodeJS, there are even &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/modules#bundling-node-modules&#34;&gt;some NodeJS packages&lt;/a&gt; that you can bundle for use with your scripts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;no-external-dependencies&#34;&gt;No external dependencies&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k6 doesn&amp;rsquo;t require NodeJS or anything else to run, which also reduces the likelihood of bugs that might affect your scripts. For example, since JMeter runs on Java, it is also dependent on Java. When Java receives a new version, that often requires a JMeter update as well. JMeter versions understandably lag a bit behind Java versions as developers refactor code, but this gap can lead to potential security issues in a previous version of Java that may remain unpatched in the meantime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With k6, development can proceed independently of any third-party component, so major issues can be addressed more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;td&gt;Javascript&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protocols&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supports most protocols via plugins (native support for HTTP/1.1, SOAP, FTP, JDBC, LDAP, MOM via JMS, SMTP, POP3, IMAP, shell scripts, TCP, Java objects)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Supports fewer, modern protocols natively (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, WebSockets, gRPC)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threading model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1 Thread: 1 Virtual User; Slower performance, higher resource cost&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Difficult to work on simultaneously; tester-friendly; need the GUI app to edit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Developer-friendly, easy to version; Javascript format promotes collaboration&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maintenance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Verbose scripts; XML format is difficult to read&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;More concise scripts; JavaScript is easy to read&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Since 1998; Many third-party tutorials; Extensive documentation; No central community&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Since 2017; Extensive documentation; Fewer third-party tutorials; &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.k6.io/&#34;&gt;Official community&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plugin support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Requires plugins for many features, but there are lots of plugins available&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Most features are natively supported, but plugin support is new and availability is sparse&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Native distributed load generation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Yes&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No (Premium only)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-generated reports&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Default and custom HTML reports; logging via listeners&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;No built-in pre-generated reports; integration with analytics tools with third-party dashboards&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/loadimpact/k6&#34;&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best advice, when attempting to choose a load testing tool, is to do a proof of concept with the most promising candidates. Some features or bugs may prove more or less important when used in an actual testing cycle. However, don&amp;rsquo;t put too much weight on comparisons of the load test &lt;em&gt;results&lt;/em&gt; from two different tools - each tool records metrics differently, and it&amp;rsquo;s more meaningful to compare results against previous runs with the same tool. When switching tools, reestablish a baseline in the new tool each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary that might help you decide between JMeter and k6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;both-tools-do-well-at&#34;&gt;Both tools do well at:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generating protocol-level load on an application server by scripting complex user flows&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Realistic scripting with the use of dynamic think time, test data generation and reuse, and customizable workload models&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Documentation of features and consistency of releases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;neither-tool-supports&#34;&gt;Neither tool supports:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generating browser-level load and interacting with DOM elements, especially for SPA&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Detailed results analysis (JMeter has pre-generated HTML reports and listeners, but they are far from ideal). Users should expect to integrate results with databases and data visualization software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;jmeter-is-best-for&#34;&gt;JMeter is best for:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;traditional testing teams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those looking for a GUI-driven testing tool with tons of third-party tutorials and extensive protocol support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;previous users of commercial tools like LoadRunner and NeoLoad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;k6-is-best-for&#34;&gt;k6 is best for:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collaborative, cross-functional engineering teams where testing spans acrosss multiple roles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;those looking for a simple and lightweight, yet fully-featured load testing tool&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;teams looking to integrate testing into existing development workflows and CI/CD pipelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Load testing scripting tools are by no means the most important consideration for the success of load testing. Knowing &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;rsquo;re testing, what the requirements are, and understanding and communicating results are all arguably more important. The right tool will enable you to address those concerns while providing as little friction as possible. There&amp;rsquo;s no unequivocal &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; tool; there&amp;rsquo;s only the right tool for &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; project and context.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week of Testing Wrap-up: My thoughts on k6 as a load testing tool</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20201217-week-of-testing-07/</link>

      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20201217-week-of-testing-07/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I decided to make a final wrap-up video for my &amp;ldquo;Week of Testing&amp;rdquo; with k6&amp;hellip; ok, so it&amp;rsquo;s actually three weeks later now, but I wanted to explore k6 a little bit more before I gave my opinion on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zVjLBp543E4&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;rsquo;s the audio version:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/0YgYqrPpEzEMSZIloeiQtC&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;232&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowtransparency=&#34;true&#34; allow=&#34;encrypted-media&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, k6, for being awesome enough to agree to this video series before knowing what I&amp;rsquo;d say. Gotta love a company that welcomes transparency and feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week of Testing: Day 5 - The thing about learning in public</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20201128-week-of-testing-5/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 28 Nov 2020 20:03:04 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20201128-week-of-testing-5/</guid>
      <description>
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/quoOYnweKw&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I mentioned that I&amp;rsquo;d used the &lt;code&gt;constant-vus&lt;/code&gt; executor to recreate the stepped load profile. Well, the thing about learning publicly is that it also means making mistakes publicly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was kindly informed by a few of my new colleagues that &lt;code&gt;constant-vus&lt;/code&gt; was not the most optimal way to recreate the stepped load profile. &lt;a href=&#34;https://simme.dev&#34;&gt;Simme&lt;/a&gt; wrote up a little function so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to repeat myself so much, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ppcano_&#34;&gt;Pepe Cano&lt;/a&gt; and Pawel Suwala (the CTO of k6 himself) both told me nicely that using &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/running-k6#stages-ramping-up-down-vus&#34;&gt;stages&lt;/a&gt; would have been the better solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let&amp;rsquo;s chalk that up to a TIL (Today I Learned) and record that snippet here for prosperity (found in the k6 documentation linked above):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-javascript&#34; data-lang=&#34;javascript&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;http&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;k6/http&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;check&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;k6&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;options&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; {
  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;stages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; [
    { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;30s&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt; },
    { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;1m30s&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; },
    { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;duration&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;20s&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;target&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; },
  ],
};

&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; () {

  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;);

      <title>Week of Testing: Day 4 - Load profiles on k6</title>

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/jDmMmc75RRM&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;k6 has a cool feature where even if you start a load test locally via the CLI, you can still stream the results to k6 Cloud. It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting compromise between debugging a test locally (and therefore not paying for cloud infrastructure) and sharing results for load tests run on the cloud. It worked seamlessly, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to see how to recreate a specific load profile that I commonly use - the stepped load profile. In JMeter, I typically do this with a plugin - the jp@gc Ultimate Thread Group is my thread group of choice. So, I created it in JMeter (I love that it shows a little image of it as well, while you&amp;rsquo;re building it) and then attempted to recreate it in k6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely had to look at the k6 documentation for this. I used the &lt;code&gt;constant-vus&lt;/code&gt; executor for this, but k6 has &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/scenarios#executors&#34;&gt;several other executors&lt;/a&gt; to choose from, and it worked as well as I had hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, my experience with k6 has been positive. Things are well-documented, and they just work out of the box. No plugins necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week of Testing: Day 3 - Running a load test locally using k6</title>
      <link>https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20201126-week-of-testing-3/</link>

&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/y5tteMKZUqk&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had my fun playing around with k6 Cloud, the SaaS component. For Day 3, I thought it was time to jump into the heart of k6: k6 the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/loadimpact/k6&#34;&gt;open source load testing tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First impressions: logging was a little sparser than I expect, coming from having used load testing tools that just do this for me automatically. I think one of the first things I&amp;rsquo;ll do with k6 is to create my own little &amp;ldquo;load testing starting script&amp;rdquo; that I&amp;rsquo;ll always use, with all of the appropriate logging already set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I was really impressed with how quickly it installed. If you scrub over to the timestamp &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5tteMKZUqk&amp;amp;ab_channel=k6&amp;amp;ts=106&#34;&gt;1:46&lt;/a&gt; in the video, you&amp;rsquo;ll hear that I was actually expecting to have to speed up the installation process while editing to save time, but the installation actually finished before I could say that I was going to do so. By my count that was 7 seconds between hitting enter in my terminal and the download finishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t help but compare that to &lt;a href=&#34;https://jmeter.apache.org/&#34;&gt;JMeter&lt;/a&gt;. JMeter is honestly probably my go-to load testing right now&amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s not good for absolutely everything, but it&amp;rsquo;s the tool that I reach for when I &amp;ldquo;just want to test this one thing&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it for years, and it&amp;rsquo;s the tool that I know the most. But one of the issues with JMeter is that there&amp;rsquo;s so much to do before it&amp;rsquo;s actually usable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you even open JMeter, you need to install Java, and when I first started in load testing, I spent a long time wrestling with getting setting the Java environment variable in Windows before my computer would even recognize that Java was installed. Then you need to install JMeter&amp;ndash; but any JMeter tester will tell you that there are some plugins that you just can&amp;rsquo;t do without, and that really you should always install. That&amp;rsquo;s why there are so many &amp;ldquo;best plugins in JMeter&amp;rdquo; lists (&lt;a href=&#34;https://nicolevanderhoeven.github.io/blog/20200414-aaf11&#34;&gt;here&amp;rsquo;s my top 3&lt;/a&gt;)&amp;hellip; because most of them are necessary, but you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t know that if you&amp;rsquo;re new to JMeter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that k6 starts up in 7 seconds is&amp;hellip; shockingly good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 2 of my Week of Testing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I ran my first load test on k6, and actually set up the thresholds wrong. I still maintain that there are some UI improvements that could still be made in that area, and that feedback was well-received. Apparently I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one who has made the same mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I learned that on k6, you can actually set one test to be a baseline. There&amp;rsquo;s so much I want to say on this topic - that&amp;rsquo;s probably a whole blog post there - but for now, suffice it to say that having a baseline test to compare succeeding tests to is a key to a successful round of load testing. I was happy to see that k6 thinks so too, because that functionality is built into the UI by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think that being able to schedule a test regularly is fantastic for practicing Continuous Testing. Of course, teams already using CI/CD pipelines would probably get the most benefit out of running load tests using the command line rather than through the UI, but it&amp;rsquo;s nice to know that scheduling is an option in the UI as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week of Testing: Day 1 - Running a load test on k6</title>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On my first real day of testing with &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io&#34;&gt;k6.io&lt;/a&gt;, I wanted to jump right in and figure out how to run a load test on k6 Cloud. k6 has documentation on this, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t use it for this test, since the point of a week of testing is to record how easy the product is to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My verdict: I&amp;rsquo;m pleasantly surprised with how easily everything went. Is it just me, or was that AWS startup time exceptionally fast? I&amp;rsquo;m used to AWS taking at least a couple of minutes to provision a machine, but this seemed to start up almost instantaneously.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Week of Testing: Intro</title>

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today was my first day at &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io&#34;&gt;k6.io&lt;/a&gt;! I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve joined as their newest Developer Advocate for Performance Testing. k6 is a company I&amp;rsquo;ve had my eye on for a while, even (or maybe especially) when I was working for a competitor, &lt;a href=&#34;https://flood.io&#34;&gt;Tricentis Flood&lt;/a&gt;. I always admired k6&amp;rsquo;s stance on open source, their involvement with the developer community, and the slick web app that brings load testing into the hands of many developers and testers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a load tester, I try to be tool-agnostic. I have to admit, though, that I do have a strong bias towards opensource tools. I joined Flood because of their focus on tools I already loved like &lt;a href=&#34;http://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi&#34;&gt;JMeter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gatling.io/&#34;&gt;Gatling&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://element.flood.io&#34;&gt;Element&lt;/a&gt; (based on Puppeteer). (And Selenium, but it&amp;rsquo;s a stretch to say I love Selenium.) But these are tools I&amp;rsquo;ve used for years, most of them from even before I joined Flood. What kind of load tester would I be if I could only really talk about scripting in a handful of tools?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I thought it was time for a change, and k6 was the first and only company on my list for a couple reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/loadimpact/k6&#34;&gt;The free and open source tool k6&lt;/a&gt;, which recently crossed over to 10,000 stars on Github, is often touted as the developer&amp;rsquo;s load testing tool of choice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;k6&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://k6.io/cloud&#34;&gt;cloud offering&lt;/a&gt; integrates seamlessly with the OSS tool, and it adds some killer features like performance insights that add real value to teams wanting to scale their load tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The k6 team is incredibly responsive to the needs of their community. Unlike most companies, where only marketing, sales, and customer support people talk to customers, k6 developers are active on GitHub, social media, and other blog sites. Everyone is passionate about what they&amp;rsquo;re building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Roles in testing are changing, and the lines between tester and developer are blurring. Developers who don&amp;rsquo;t test are going to become just as obsolete as testers who don&amp;rsquo;t develop. I see k6&amp;rsquo;s popularity among the developer crowd as a good opportunity for me to sharpen my coding skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had to see for myself whether k6 was actually as good as it seemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, it turns out that k6 has a tradition of a &amp;ldquo;Week of Testing&amp;rdquo;, where every new member of the k6 team, regardless of role, spends their first week putting the product through its paces. Every part of the whole k6 solution (Cloud and OSS tool) is fair game, and the goal of the Week of Testing is to present feedback to the team at the end of it, while the new member&amp;rsquo;s eyes are fresh. When they told me about it, they said &amp;ldquo;We want to see you learn the tool on your own to see what parts are difficult to figure out.&amp;rdquo; To which I responded, &amp;ldquo;Challenge accepted!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to not only give a presentation at the end, but also to video the process for posterity&amp;rsquo;s sake&amp;hellip; and, let&amp;rsquo;s face it, to impress my new managers and coworkers with my dazzling work ethic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Get the company&amp;rsquo;s name right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first video, I share the differences between k6 vs. k6 Cloud vs. Load Impact!&lt;/p&gt;
